Issues, Interpretation, and Debate <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bible, encompassing the Old and
New Testaments, contains numerous passages that modern readers find ethically
problematic. These include verses that appear to condone <span class=s2><b>slavery
and other human rights violations</b></span>, impose harsh <span class=s2><b>restrictions
on personal freedom</b></span>, conflict with contemporary <span class=s2><b>universal
values of equality and justice</b></span>, advocate severe treatment of <span
class=s2><b>women and children</b></span>, or <span class=s2><b>promote
violence</b></span> in the name of religion. For example, the Hebrew Bible’s
legal codes permit slave-owning, mandate capital punishment for religious offenses,
and prescribe patriarchal rules for women’s behavior. Likewise, biblical
narratives describe divinely sanctioned wars of extermination and harsh
punishments that seem to violate modern standards of human rights. This report
provides an analysis of these problematic contents: first summarizing the main
areas of concern (slavery, violence, treatment of women, treatment of children,
and related issues), then examining whether the biblical text presents these as
negatives to learn from or as acceptable norms. Next, it explores how Believer
interpreters—both <span class=s2><b>traditional</b></span> (e.g. Catholic and
conservative Protestant) and <span class=s2><b>modern liberal</b></span>
theologians—have defended or rationalized such passages. Finally, it offers
counterarguments challenging those defenses. Throughout, we reference
theological and historical scholarship to provide context and evidence for each
point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Categories of Problematic Content in
Scripture<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Slavery and Human Rights Violations<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One of the most glaring issues is
the Bible’s treatment of <span class=s2><b>slavery</b></span>. Both Old and New
Testament passages regulate and <span class=s2><b>accept slavery as an
institution</b></span> rather than condemn it. In the Old Testament Law of
Moses, Israelites were explicitly allowed to purchase slaves from foreign
nations and keep them as property permanently. Leviticus 25, for instance,
permits taking slaves from neighboring peoples and treating them as inheritable
property (Lev 25:44–46). Hebrew slaves (i.e. fellow Israelites) could be kept
for six years and freed in the seventh, but non-Hebrew slaves and war captives
could be enslaved for life. The laws even state that a master would not be
punished if he beat his slave to death <i>as long as the slave survived a day
or two</i>, since “the slave is the owner’s property” (Exodus 21:21) . Such
passages leave little doubt that <span class=s2><b>chattel slavery</b></span>
(owning another person as property) is affirmed in the Old Testament. Owning
many slaves is even portrayed as a sign of divine favor in some narratives
(e.g. God blessed patriarchs like Abraham with servants/slaves). There are <span
class=s2><b>literally dozens of references to slavery</b></span> in the Bible
mentioned “in passing, without comment” as a normal part of life. Nowhere in
the Hebrew Bible are the ethics of slave-owning directly criticized; instead,
the text provides rules on how to manage slavery (for example, Exodus 21,
Deuteronomy 15). This stands in stark conflict with modern universal human
rights, which hold that owning a human being as property is fundamentally
unjust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The New Testament also <span
class=s2><b>fails to repudiate slavery</b></span>. On the contrary, several New
Testament letters instruct slaves to <i>obey their masters “in everything”</i>
(see Ephesians 6:5, Colossians 3:22). The Apostle Paul, while teaching that
spiritually “there is neither slave nor free” in Christ (Galatians 3:28),
nevertheless advises Believer slaves to submit to their earthly masters with
respect and sincerity, and he tells masters to treat slaves kindly but does not
tell them to release their slaves (Ephesians 6:5–9, Colossians 4:1). First
Peter 2:18 even urges slaves to accept suffering, <span class=s2><b>“even if it
means being beaten,”</b></span> as a commendable example of Christlike endurance.
Perhaps most striking is the brief New Testament book of <span class=s2><b>Philemon</b></span>,
a letter from Paul regarding a runaway slave, <span class=s2><b>Onesimus</b></span>.
In this letter, Paul sends Onesimus back to his Believer master Philemon and <i>stops
short of demanding</i> that Philemon free him. Paul appeals to Philemon to
receive Onesimus “no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear
brother” (Philemon 1:16) and hints that Philemon should do “even more than I
say” (1:21), which many interpret as a suggestion of freeing him. Yet Paul does
not explicitly condemn slaveholding; he couches his request politely and within
the existing system of slavery. As a result, <span class=s2><b>slaveholders
throughout history found plenty of biblical support</b></span> for their
practices. Indeed, during the 19th-century debates on slavery in America,
Southern slave owners frequently <span class=s2><b>“waved Bibles over their
heads”</b></span> and pointed out that <i>nowhere</i> does the Bible say “Believers
can’t own people” . Critics note that if the Bible were truly the literal and
infallible word of a just God, it is troubling that it “got the <i>easiest</i>
moral question humanity has ever faced wrong” by failing to clearly forbid
slavery. The acceptance of slavery in Scripture represents a profound conflict
with today’s values of <span class=s2><b>freedom and human dignity</b></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Violence, Warfare, and Religious Intolerance<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Another major category of
problematic content is the <span class=s2><b>extreme violence</b></span>
commanded or carried out in the Bible, often with divine approval. The Old
Testament, in particular, contains many accounts of <span class=s2><b>warfare,
massacre, and even genocide</b></span>. For example, in the conquest of Canaan
under Joshua, the Israelites are repeatedly instructed by God to <span
class=s2><b>exterminate entire populations</b></span> of cities: “you shall
utterly destroy them… show them no mercy” (Deuteronomy 7:2, 20:16-17). In the
Book of Joshua, this command is carried out at cities like Jericho, where “men
and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys” were put to the sword .
Similarly, in 1 Samuel 15:3, God instructs King Saul to attack the Amalekites
and <i>“totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to
death men and women, children and infants.”</i> These texts depict God ordering
what we would now label <span class=s2><b>genocide</b></span> – the killing of
entire ethnic groups, including non-combatants and children. In the biblical
narrative, such actions are presented as a form of divine judgment or as
necessary for the protection of Israel from idolatry. There is no indication
within the stories that this violence is morally problematic; on the contrary,
failure to fully carry out the ban (herem) is rebuked (as when Saul is rejected
by God for sparing some Amalekites and livestock in 1 Samuel 15). These
accounts raise severe ethical concerns: <i>How can the mass killing of infants
and innocents be justified?</i> Modern readers often feel that these stories
conflict sharply with universal humanitarian values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Beyond warfare, <span class=s2><b>religious
intolerance and violent punishment for dissent</b></span> are enshrined in
biblical law. The First Commandment forbids worship of other gods, and laws in
Deuteronomy prescribe the death penalty for <span class=s2><b>idolatry or
apostasy</b></span>. Deuteronomy 13 famously mandates that if anyone, even a
family member, entices you to serve other gods, <i>“you shall not yield to them
or listen to them… You shall stone them to death”</i> – <i>“your hand shall be
first against them to put them to death”</i>, and <i>“you shall not pity them”</i>
. Entire towns that turn to other gods are to be destroyed with the sword,
their inhabitants and even livestock slaughtered and the town burned to rubble
(Deut. 13:12-18). In essence, the Bible’s law codes envision a <span class=s2><b>theocratic
society with zero tolerance for religious divergence</b></span>, enforced by
capital punishment. Such prescriptions violate modern principles of <span
class=s2><b>freedom of religion and belief</b></span>. Similarly, <span
class=s2><b>blasphemy</b></span> was punishable by death (Leviticus 24:16). <span
class=s2><b>Adultery</b></span> and certain sexual behaviors were also capital
crimes under the Torah. The cumulative impression is a legal system that
employs <span class=s2><b>execution as punishment for a wide range of offenses</b></span>,
including things that today would be considered matters of personal conscience
or private morality. This draconian approach is at odds with contemporary views
on human rights and the limits of state (or religious) violence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Even God’s own actions in the Bible
can be seen as disturbingly violent. The <span class=s2><b>Genesis Flood</b></span>
(Genesis 6–9) describes God wiping out virtually all of humanity (and land
animals) with a cataclysmic flood, sparing only Noah’s family—essentially an
act of <span class=s2><b>mass destruction</b></span> of life on earth presented
as righteous judgment for human wickedness. In the story of <span class=s2><b>Sodom
and Gomorrah</b></span> (Genesis 19), God destroys entire cities with fire and
brimstone. The <span class=s2><b>Plagues of Egypt</b></span> climax with the
death of every firstborn child in Egypt (Exodus 12), a divinely inflicted mass
killing of children to force Pharaoh’s hand. These narratives portray God
directly causing widespread death and suffering. In the New Testament, while
the overall tone is less focused on earthly violence, there are passages that
remain problematic. The Book of <span class=s2><b>Revelation</b></span>
contains graphically violent imagery of divine wrath (plagues, wars, and a
final battle) and the establishment of God’s kingdom by force. Jesus himself,
though preaching love and enemy-forgiveness in many places, also speaks of
coming judgment using violent metaphors (e.g. in a parable he describes a king
saying <i>“as for those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over
them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence”</i>, Luke 19:27). Such
verses have at times been taken out of context to justify religious violence.
At minimum, they show that even the New Testament is not entirely free of
violent content (for instance, <span class=s2><b>Jesus predicting he brings
“not peace but a sword”</b></span> in Matthew 10:34, which, while generally
interpreted as metaphorical division, can be unsettling to readers).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Crucially, <span class=s2><b>many of
these violent passages are not explicitly presented as bad examples</b></span>.
Instead, when violence is commanded by God or carried out by Israel at God’s
behest, the text implies approval. The conquest of Canaan is narrated as the
fulfillment of God’s promise and as a holy duty; there is <span class=s2><b>no
voice within the text questioning the ethics</b></span> of the slaughter. When
the prophets later recall these events, they do not condemn Joshua for
violence; rather, disobedience to God’s command (like failing to eliminate all
idolaters) is criticized. This lack of internal critique makes these passages
especially challenging. Some other violent stories do have a negative framing –
for example, the <span class=s2><b>Book of Judges</b></span> depicts a time of
chaos and moral degeneracy, and it includes horrific violence (like the rape
and murder of the Levite’s concubine in Judges 19, or Jephthah’s sacrifice of
his daughter in Judges 11). These stories are meant to illustrate how bad
things got “when everyone did what was right in their own eyes” (Judges 21:25)
in the absence of righteous leadership . <i>Feminist scholars point out</i>,
however, that even in such cases the <span class=s2><b>text often does not
explicitly condemn the violence against women</b></span>; the cruelty is
described, but no divine law is given to punish the perpetrators in the
narrative . This leads some critics to argue that the Bible gives <span
class=s2><b>“tacit approval”</b></span> to these acts by not speaking out
against them . In summary, the Bible’s handling of violence—frequently <span
class=s2><b>encouraging or commanding it</b></span> in certain
contexts—conflicts with modern ideals of peace, human rights, and the intrinsic
value of human life (including the lives of <i>enemies</i> or <i>non-believers</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Treatment of Women and Gender Inequality<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bible was composed in <span
class=s2><b>patriarchal cultures</b></span>, and this context is reflected in
many passages that modern readers see as sexist or oppressive toward <span
class=s2><b>women</b></span>. In the Old Testament, women’s social and legal
status was generally <span class=s2><b>subordinate to men</b></span>. Women
were often viewed as the property or dependents of their fathers or husbands.
For instance, the Ten Commandments list a man’s wife among his possessions not
to covet (Exodus 20:17), implying wives were part of a man’s household
property. Various laws in the Torah illustrate inequality: a daughter could be given
in marriage without her consent, polygamy was practiced by many prominent men
(and regulated in law rather than forbidden), and men could <span class=s2><b>take
concubines (slave-wives)</b></span> with fewer rights. If a woman was raped,
the law’s solution in certain cases was that she had to marry her rapist:
Deuteronomy 22:28–29 states that a man who rapes an unbetrothed virgin must pay
the girl’s father a bride-price and <i>“she shall become his wife.”</i> This
was presumably meant to ensure the woman’s financial security after the assault
(since her prospects for marriage were damaged) , but from a modern perspective
it is a horrific prospect – effectively a law forcing a victim to live with her
attacker. (Some apologists argue the woman’s consent was still required or that
it was primarily an obligation on the man, but the text itself does not voice
the woman’s perspective.) Adultery laws also treated women differently: a
married woman who slept with a man was committing adultery (a crime punishable
by death for both parties), but a married man who slept with an unmarried woman
was not necessarily considered an adulterer (polygyny was allowed).
Inheritances typically passed through male lines; daughters inherited only if
there were no sons (Numbers 27). Women could be divorced by husbands relatively
easily in ancient Israel (Deut. 24:1-4) whereas a wife did not have a similar
right. Moreover, certain purity laws placed additional burdens on women – for
example, after giving birth, a woman was considered ritually <i>“unclean”</i>
for 40 days if she bore a son, but <span class=s2><b>80 days if she bore a
daughter</b></span> (Leviticus 12:1-5), a distinction that many see as implying
a lesser status for female offspring. All these reflect cultural norms of the
ancient Near East, but they <span class=s2><b>conflict with modern principles
of gender equality</b></span> and women’s rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Narrative sections of the Bible also
contain disturbing treatment of women. Women are sometimes subjected to sexual
violence and their suffering is narrated with little comment. Two of the most <i>“egregious
examples”</i> of violence against women in Scripture occur in Judges: <span
class=s2><b>Jephthah’s daughter</b></span> (Judges 11:29–40), whom Jephthah
tragically sacrifices due to a rash vow, and the unnamed <span class=s2><b>concubine
of a Levite</b></span> who is gang-raped and left to die (Judges 19) . These
texts are gut-wrenching. While the overall context of Judges implies Israel’s
moral breakdown, <i>the stories themselves do not include editorial remarks
explicitly condemning the acts</i>. The horror is apparent, but the Bible often
“speaks in silence” – it presents the deed and its consequences (e.g. a civil
war erupting after the outrage in Judges 19–20) rather than direct moral
commentary. This ambiguity has led to debate: some argue the Bible is simply
describing human sin here (not endorsing it), yet others point out that <span
class=s2><b>God never intervenes or provides justice for the female victims</b></span>
in these stories, raising questions about the text’s stance . Elsewhere, the
Bible’s heroes themselves treat women in ways that clash with modern ethics.
Lot, for instance, in Genesis 19 offers his virgin daughters to an angry mob to
protect his male guests – an act portrayed as misguided hospitality at best,
and deeply immoral by today’s standards. Yet Lot is not explicitly condemned in
the text for this offer; instead, he is later called “righteous” in the New
Testament (2 Peter 2:7), likely for opposing Sodom’s sins, not for his
treatment of his daughters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the New Testament, women’s status
improves in some respects (Jesus’s inclusive attitude toward women, female
disciples like Mary Magdalene, etc.), but <span class=s2><b>certain passages
remain problematic</b></span>. Paul’s epistles contain instructions that <span
class=s2><b>women should be submissive and silent</b></span> in church
gatherings and that they are not permitted to teach or have authority over men.
The clearest example is 1 Corinthians 14:34-35: <i>“As in all the churches of
the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted
to speak, but should be in submission, as the law says. If there is anything
they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful
for a woman to speak in church.”</i> Similarly, 1 Timothy 2:11-12 (a letter
attributed to Paul, though likely written by a later follower) says a woman
must learn in quietness and full submission and “I do not permit a woman to
teach or to exercise authority over a man.” These passages have been used for
centuries to bar women from leadership roles in church and to justify a general
doctrine of female subordination in both church and home. They are in tension
with other New Testament evidence of women playing active roles in the early Believer
movement (for example, Priscilla teaching Apollos in Acts 18, or Phoebe being a
deacon commended by Paul in Romans 16). Nonetheless, the plain words of the
text present a <span class=s2><b>restrictive view of women’s role</b></span>.
Likewise, the household codes in Ephesians and Colossians instruct, <i>“Wives,
submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord”</i> (Col. 3:18, Eph. 5:22)
and only then tell husbands to love their wives. The <span class=s2><b>authority
hierarchy</b></span> (husband as head, wife as subordinate) is taken for
granted. First Peter 3:1 says similarly, “wives, be subject to your own
husbands,” and even if the husband is an unbeliever, her reverent behavior
might win him over. Peter also calls women <i>“the weaker vessel”</i> (1 Pet.
3:7) while urging husbands to honor them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Such texts clearly reflect a
worldview in which gender roles are <span class=s2><b>unequal</b></span> – men
lead, women follow. This conflicts with modern assertions of <span class=s2><b>women’s
equal capability and rights</b></span> in all spheres of life. To many today,
verses about silencing women or compelling their submission are not just
antiquated, but unjust. Even if these instructions made sense in a
first-century context, taken as timeless divine commands they have upheld systems
that limit women’s freedom (for example, some Believer traditions long forbade
women from higher education or jobs, citing these scriptures). Notably, the
Bible contains no outright statement that women possess equal authority to men
in family or church governance. At best, one can find a principle of spiritual
equality (“in Christ there is no male or female,” Gal. 3:28) and examples of
women whom God used in significant ways (Deborah as a judge and prophetess, for
instance). But those exceptions do not overturn the general patriarchal pattern
in Scripture. <span class=s2><b>No biblical author systematically argues for
women’s social equality</b></span> as we understand it today. Therefore, many
passages about women come into direct conflict with contemporary values of <span
class=s2><b>gender equality, women’s rights, and personal autonomy</b></span>.
They can be deeply troubling, especially to women readers who find that the
holy text seems to relegate them to silence or second-class status.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Harsh Punishments and Children’s Rights<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bible also contains commands and
narratives that modern readers see as <span class=s2><b>violating children’s
rights and welfare</b></span>. A stark example is the law of the “<span
class=s2><b>rebellious son</b></span>” in Deuteronomy 21:18-21. This law states
that if parents have a stubborn and disobedient son who refuses to reform, they
can bring him to the city elders and have him stoned to death by the men of the
city. <i>“All the men of his city shall stone him with stones, so that he dies.
So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear, and
fear”</i> (Deut. 21:21). There is no age explicitly given, but the context
implies an older adolescent (he is called “son” but is a glutton and drunkard,
indicating at least a teenager). While some later Jewish interpreters greatly
limited this law’s applicability (arguing, for example, that it was never
actually carried out and was meant as a theoretical deterrent) , <i>in the text
itself</i> this punishment is presented as a legitimate option to “purge evil.”
It is effectively a <span class=s2><b>death penalty for juvenile delinquency</b></span>.
To any modern sensibility, executing a child for being rebellious is an
appalling notion and a gross violation of a child’s basic rights to life and
due process. There is no indication in Scripture that this law was to be taken
as symbolic; it appears in the legal code alongside other rules. As noted,
later Jewish tradition records that <i>“there never had been, nor ever will be,
a rebellious son [executed]; the law was given for educational purposes”</i> .
While this mitigates the practical horror, it underscores that <i>the Torah’s
literal words, if applied, would allow</i> such an execution. The existence of
such a law in the Bible is hard to reconcile with modern norms that children
should be protected and guided with patience, not subject to violent
retribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>More commonly cited are the proverbs
advocating <span class=s2><b>corporal punishment of children</b></span>.
Proverbs 13:24 declares, <i>“Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who
loves him is diligent to discipline him.”</i> Similarly, Proverbs 23:13-14 says
one should not withhold discipline: <i>“If you strike him with the rod, he will
not die. If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol.”</i>
These verses have been summarized in the saying “spare the rod, spoil the
child.” Traditional readers take them as endorsement of physical spanking or
whipping as a necessary form of discipline. Indeed, such verses have been
widely cited in many cultures to justify corporal punishment of children in the
home and even in schools . In recent decades, however, a growing understanding
of children’s psychological and physical well-being has led many to view
corporal punishment as harmful “abuse” rather than loving discipline. Child
welfare advocates strongly criticize any suggestion that beating children is
divinely approved. The Bible’s advice on using the “rod” is therefore seen by
some as <span class=s2><b>promoting violence against children</b></span>.
Apologists counter that these proverbs intend disciplined guidance, not abuse,
and should be understood in the context of <span class=s2><b>loving correction</b></span>
. Nonetheless, the plain imagery of a rod and the statement that not using it
means you hate your child strikes many today as contrary to the principle that
child-rearing should avoid physical harm and prioritize positive reinforcement.
The Bible includes <i>no explicit acknowledgment of children’s autonomous
rights or personhood separate from their parents’ authority</i>. Children are
generally viewed as under the dominion of parents, who even have power of life
and death (as seen in the rebellious son law). This, too, is inconsistent with
modern conceptions of <span class=s2><b>children’s rights</b></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Beyond disciplinary issues, some
biblical narratives involve <span class=s2><b>children in episodes of violence
and suffering</b></span> that raise moral questions. We have already mentioned
how in wartime narratives, even infants are not spared (as in the Amalekite and
Canaanite wars). The story of Abraham’s near-sacrifice of <span class=s2><b>Isaac</b></span>
(Genesis 22) is often praised within the Judeo-Believer tradition as the
ultimate test of faith and obedience to God. Yet, ethically, the idea that God
would command a father to slit his own child’s throat as a sacrifice is deeply
troubling (even though, in the story, God stops Abraham at the last moment).
The narrative’s focus is on Abraham’s faith, not on Isaac’s trauma. Some
readers feel this story borders on endorsing <i>the notion that blind obedience
to God transcends even the most basic parental instinct to protect one’s child</i>.
In a modern view, asking a parent to kill their child is an unconscionable
demand, not a virtuous test. Likewise, the story of <span class=s2><b>Jephthah’s
daughter</b></span> (Judges 11) features a father sacrificing his only daughter
due to a vow—while the text portrays it as tragic and foolish, it does not
explicitly say God disapproved (and Jephthah is listed among people of faith in
Hebrews 11:32). Instances like these, where children are victimized (with
Jephthah’s daughter essentially a human sacrifice) or put at risk in religious
contexts, are hard to reconcile with the inherent value of children’s lives
recognized today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Finally, an especially grim verse
often cited is <span class=s2><b>Psalm 137:9</b></span>, where the psalmist,
exiled in Babylon, expresses rage against Israel’s enemies and says, “<i>Happy
is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</i>” This
shocking image of infanticide is a cry for vengeance. Though it is poetic
hyperbole spoken by a human (not a command from God), its presence in the Bible
is jolting. It exemplifies the raw violence in some biblical poetry that
conflicts with modern ethics. Readers understand the context of suffering
behind such a line, yet it remains an example of <span class=s2><b>violent
rhetoric</b></span> that is hard to square with universal love of neighbor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><span class=s4><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In summary,

<h2><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Negative Examples or Endorsed Norms?
(Biblical Perspective)<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It’s important to analyze <i>whether
each problematic story or law in the Bible is presented as something negative
(to teach a lesson against it) or as an endorsed norm</i>. The Bible is an
anthology of texts spanning many centuries, and it contains both <span
class=s2><b>descriptive passages</b></span> (narratives of what happened, not
necessarily condoning it) and <span class=s2><b>prescriptive passages</b></span>
(commands or laws). Understanding which is which can influence how we judge the
text’s stance on these issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In <span class=s2><b>some cases, the
Bible itself makes clear that a story of wrongdoing is meant to be a cautionary
tale</b></span>. A good example is the <span class=s2><b>violence and chaos in
the Book of Judges</b></span>. The final chapters of Judges (17–21) contain
horrific events like civil war and the abuse of the Levite’s concubine. These
are bracketed by the comment, <i>“In those days there was no king in Israel;
everyone did what was right in his own eyes”</i> (Judg. 21:25) . This refrain
signals that the narrator views the situation as disordered and negative.
Scholars note that the <i>“deteriorating status of women and the violence done
to them”</i> in Judges is depicted as a barometer of Israel’s moral decline .
In other words, the <span class=s2><b>Bible is not celebrating</b></span> the
rape and murder in Judges 19; rather, it’s showing how far the people fell from
God’s ideal. Similarly, <span class=s2><b>King David’s adultery with Bathsheba
and his arranged murder of her husband</b></span> (2 Samuel 11) are clearly portrayed
as sins—David is confronted by the prophet Nathan and punished by God (2 Sam.
12). Thus, <i>narratives of individual moral failures</i> (like David’s sin, or
Solomon’s polygamy leading him into idolatry) are often explicitly or
implicitly <span class=s2><b>negative examples</b></span>. We are meant to
learn <i>“don’t do this; it leads to disaster.”</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On the other hand, <span class=s2><b>many
troubling passages are not presented as wrongful at all</b></span>, but rather
as righteous or divinely authorized. This is especially true for <span
class=s2><b>divine commands and legal stipulations</b></span>. For instance,
the laws on <span class=s2><b>slavery</b></span> in Exodus and Leviticus are
given in the same matter-of-fact tone as laws on theft or restitution; there is
no suggestion in the text that slavery is regrettable. To the contrary, these
rules are part of God’s covenant code for Israel. This implies that the
biblical authors (and presumably their understanding of God’s will) considered
regulated slavery morally acceptable at that time. <span class=s2><b>No prophet
ever rises up in Israel to say “Thus says the Lord: Free all your slaves.”</b></span>
The <span class=s2><b>abolition of slavery</b></span> is not a theme found
anywhere in Scripture; the abolitionist impulse arose much later in history
(with Believers eventually opposing slavery <i>in spite of</i> the Bible’s
clear permission of it, rather than because of an explicit biblical mandate).
Therefore, one must conclude that within the biblical world, slavery was <span
class=s2><b>normalized</b></span>, not presented as an evil to eliminate. The
oppression of the Israelites as slaves in Egypt is portrayed as a great evil
(Exodus portrays Egyptian slavery as cruel and unjust), but notably, once free,
the Israelites are allowed to enslave others. The Bible thus <i>condemns
slavery only when Israelites are the victims</i>, not the practice per se. That
nuance suggests an <i>ethnocentric</i> morality (what’s wrong is oppressing
God’s chosen people; oppressing others is not equally denounced in the text).
So those passages are not cautionary tales; they are rules apparently endorsed
by God for ancient society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Similarly, the <span class=s2><b>commands
to destroy the Canaanites</b></span> are given as God’s direct instructions to
Moses and Joshua. There is no indication that this genocide is meant to be seen
as anything but necessary and good in its context (the text justifies it by the
wickedness of those nations and the danger of idolatry, e.g. Deut. 20:17-18).
The Israelites who carry it out (Joshua, etc.) are praised for obedience,
whereas failures to fully annihilate are criticized. Thus, such violence is <span
class=s2><b>presented as virtuous obedience</b></span>, not as immoral. Another
indicator is that later generations looked back on Joshua’s conquest positively
– the book of Psalms, for example, praises God’s faithfulness in helping Israel
defeat nations and gain their land (Psalm 105, 106). There is no subsequent
biblical critique of the morality of the conquest. This means the <span
class=s2><b>promotion of violence</b></span> in those texts is indeed part of
the Bible’s <i>endorsed narrative</i>, not a deviation that is corrected within
Scripture. The same goes for laws like executing idolaters or Sabbath-breakers:
those laws are given by God through Moses; the narrative in Numbers 15:32-36
where a man is stoned to death for gathering sticks on the Sabbath shows God
Himself commanding the community to carry out the execution. The text offers no
apology for this severity; it states it as justice according to the law. So,
from an internal standpoint, <span class=s2><b>strict theocratic punishments
are upheld as righteous</b></span>, not as mistakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When it comes to <span class=s2><b>women’s
roles</b></span>, the prescriptive texts (like Paul’s directives for silence or
submission) are presented as proper order in the church, not as examples of
bias to later overcome. There is no internal New Testament voice saying
“actually, women can speak/lead just as men do.” Any such egalitarian
perspective had to be read between the lines or argued from broader principles.
The explicit instructions remain restrictive. Only much later, through
historical development, did most churches re-evaluate these instructions. But
within the biblical canon itself, verses limiting women are not framed as
temporary or problematic; they’re given as <i>the Apostle’s command “as in all
churches”.</i> This makes them particularly challenging: they <i>sound like
universal principles</i>, which is why they held such sway in church practice
for so long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In other narratives, the viewpoint
is less clear, and readers debate the intent. For example, <span class=s2><b>Jephthah’s
sacrifice of his daughter</b></span>: the story (Judges 11) certainly paints
the event as tragic and foolish—Jephthah is not rewarded; his line ends. It
likely is meant to warn against rash vows. However, the text doesn’t explicitly
say “and Jephthah did evil in God’s eyes,” leaving some ambiguity. But given
the broader biblical condemnation of human sacrifice elsewhere, one can
reasonably infer that this was not endorsed by God (indeed, Jephthah is an
example of faith in Hebrews 11 for his trust in God during battle, not for the
vow). <span class=s2><b>Lot’s offer of his daughters</b></span> in Sodom is
another morally repugnant act that is not explicitly commented on; there the
text’s silence might imply it was obviously abhorrent (the story as a whole
shows the depravity of the situation). <span class=s2><b>Polygamy</b></span> is
an interesting case: many patriarchs and kings had multiple wives, and the <i>narratives
do not overtly condemn them for that</i>. Yet they often show negative
consequences (jealousy, conflict, etc.), and by the New Testament period,
monogamy is upheld as the ideal for church leaders. So some argue the Bible
subtly teaches the problems of polygamy through narrative outcomes, even if it
never bans it outright in the Old Testament. In general, though, where the
Bible wanted to make a moral lesson clear, it usually did so either through
direct command or prophetic critique. The absence of such critique for slavery,
holy war, patriarchal authority, etc., strongly suggests that <span class=s2><b>the
biblical authors did not view these as problematic</b></span> in their time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To summarize: <span class=s2><b>some
problematic stories are indeed depicted as negative examples</b></span> of
human sin (e.g. the rape in Judges is part of illustrating Israel’s corruption,
David’s abuse of power is punished, etc.), but <span class=s2><b>many
problematic laws and commands are portrayed as divine ideals or necessary
actions</b></span>, not as evils. This mixture complicates interpretation. It
means readers cannot simply dismiss all troubling passages as “the Bible
showing what <i>not</i> to do.” In many cases the Bible seems to be <i>telling</i>
people to do precisely those troubling things (kill idolaters, own slaves,
etc.). This tension has led to extensive efforts by believers to explain or
justify these passages, which we will examine next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

explanation is that God’s moral revelation was <span class=s1><b>gradual</b></span>,
meeting people where they were in their historical context and leading them
step by step to higher moral understanding. This idea of <i>“divine pedagogy”</i>
or <span class=s1><b>progressive revelation</b></span> is emphasized in
Catholic teaching. Pope Benedict XVI wrote that one must understand the
biblical belief in God by following its historical development, and that <span
class=s1><b>God’s plan “is manifested progressively and… suited to the cultural
and moral level of distant times.”</b></span> In other words, the ancient
Israelites at 1200 BC could not yet grasp the full ethics that would be
revealed through Christ; so God worked within their cultural framework (which
included slavery, patriarchal structures, etc.), <span class=s1><b>tolerating
certain things for a time</b></span> while gradually pushing towards
improvement . The Catholic Church in <i>Verbum Domini</i> (a document on
Scripture) acknowledges that the Bible sometimes narrates events or commands
without condemning their immorality by modern standards precisely because of
this accommodation to ancient moral development . For example, Catholic
commentators view the herem (ban) warfare of the Old Testament as <i>“a
survival from more primitive times”</i> that <span class=s1><b>disappeared as
Israel’s morality grew more enlightened</b></span> . By the time of Jesus,
God’s fuller revelation of love and mercy had arrived, making such practices
obsolete. Thus, a traditional Believer might say: <i>Yes, the Old Testament law
allowed slavery and harsh punishments, but God was working gradually—those laws
were a starting point, not the end of moral revelation.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

above, many argue that <span class=s1><b>Christ fulfilled and superseded</b></span>
the Old Testament law. The old law, with its severity, was meant for a
particular era and purpose (to govern Israel and expose sin), but Believers are
under a new law of love. This goes back to the early Church Fathers; for
instance, St. Augustine taught that if an Old Testament law seems to conflict
with charity (love), one should understand it spiritually rather than literally
for today. The idea is that <span class=s1><b>Jesus’ teachings correct or elevate</b></span>
prior norms. A classic example cited: Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount said, <i>“You
have heard it said, ‘An eye for an eye…’ but I say to you, resist not evil;
turn the other cheek”</i> – indicating that the older justice law (which itself
limited vengeance) is now transcended by a higher ethic of forgiveness. By
analogy, harsh measures like the ban on Canaanites might be seen as specific to
a time and not applicable after Christ’s revelation. The Catholic perspective
indeed states: <i>“Problematic passages in the Old Testament are valid insofar
as they are part of the history leading up to Christ.”</i> They are to be read
“in light of Christ” – meaning we filter them through what Jesus taught. If
something seems contrary to Jesus’ character, we are not to take it as a
standalone moral guide but as part of a larger salvation story that culminates
in Jesus. Traditionalists will often quote Jesus and the apostles to emphasize
the shift: for example, <span class=s1><b>“God is love”</b></span> (1 John 4:8)
becomes the lens through which troubling texts must ultimately be understood
(even if that means they were provisional or partial revelations).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Interpretation:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Another
approach is to claim that some of the most extreme commands were not meant to
be taken literally or did not actually happen as written. Apologist Paul Copan
and others argue that the language of total destruction in the conquest
narratives is Ancient Near Eastern <span class=s1><b>hyperbole</b></span> –
similar to sports talk (“We annihilated our opponents!”) . They note that the
Bible itself, after saying “utterly destroy,” sometimes indicates survivors,
suggesting those phrases were conventional war rhetoric. Thus, they maintain
that <span class=s1><b>God did not intend actual genocide</b></span>; rather,
the command was to defeat the Canaanites militarily and drive them out, not
necessarily kill every last woman and child . This view tries to lessen the
moral problem by asserting <i>the Bible isn’t describing what we think it is;
we’re misreading genre</i>. Similarly, some claim that the law in Deuteronomy
22 about marrying a rape victim has been misunderstood – that it was actually
about consensual premarital sex or that it was <i>protective legislation</i>,
not forcing the woman but forcing the man to provide for her (the finer points
of Hebrew wording are debated to soften the scenario) . In the New Testament
context, some conservative scholars even question whether 1 Corinthians
14:34-35 (women’s silence) was an interpolation (a later addition), since it
contrasts with other parts of Paul’s letters. While this view (held by many
modern scholars) is not mainstream among traditional inerrantists (because it
implies a copyist added it), it shows one way to handle a troubling verse:
suggest it <i>might not have been original Pauline teaching</i>. Generally,
however, the hyperbole and context argument is popular: e.g., <span class=s1><b>slavery</b></span>
in the Bible is often explained as <i>“not the race-based brutal slavery of
modern times, but a gentler form of servitude or indentured service”</i>.
Apologists note that Israelite slaves had to be freed after 7 years (Exod.
21:2) and that kidnapping someone to sell as a slave was a capital crime (Exod.
21:16). They argue that biblical-era slavery was more like a social safety net
for debt and not based on dehumanizing an entire race. They also highlight that
masters were exhorted to treat slaves well (Eph. 6:9) and that many early Believers
freed slaves. All these points serve to <span class=s1><b>contextualize slavery</b></span>,
implying the Bible’s tolerance of it was a regulated, somewhat improved version
of an ancient institution, not an endorsement of the atrocities of 18th–19th
century slavery. In short, traditional defenses often try to show the
problematic practice was <i>“not as bad as it looks”</i> in context.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=s1><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Divine Sovereignty and Justice:</span></b></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Another classic defense, especially among more
conservative Protestants, is the appeal to <span class=s1><b>God’s sovereignty
and higher moral understanding</b></span>. This is essentially: <i>God, as the
author of life, has the right to give and take life; His judgments, though
severe, are just, even if we humans don’t fully grasp them.</i> In this view,
the <span class=s1><b>Canaanite genocide is justified</b></span> because of the
extreme wickedness of those cultures (the Old Testament notes their sins like
child sacrifice, incest, etc., e.g. Lev. 18:24-25), and God’s patience had run
out after centuries. Thus, the destruction was a unique divine judgment, akin
to the Flood, to purge evil. Some argue that killing the children of these
nations, while tragic, ensured they would not grow up in that evil environment
– and <i>some even speculate in an attempt to be theologically consistent that
those children might be saved in the afterlife by God’s mercy</i>. Apologist
William Lane Craig has infamously argued that the children who died went to
heaven, so in a sense God’s command, while hard, was ultimately a mercy to them
compared to growing up in depravity. This kind of argument takes a <span
class=s1><b>divine command theory</b></span> approach: if God commanded it, it
must be morally right by definition, because God is the source of morality.
Similarly, regarding slavery or harsh punishments, one might say: <i>God
allowed those for a time for His purposes; who are we, as fallible humans, to
judge God’s directives?</i> This defense leans on faith in God’s goodness and
the assumption that <span class=s1><b>our moral intuitions are not superior to
God’s revelation</b></span>. Passages like “Shall not the Judge of all the
earth do what is just?” (Gen. 18:25) or God’s speech to Job (“Where were you
when I laid the earth’s foundation?” Job 38:4) are cited to remind believers
that <span class=s1><b>God’s ways may be beyond human understanding</b></span>.
In effect, this is an appeal to humility: even if a command seems immoral to
us, if it comes from God in Scripture, we trust there is a righteous reason
behind it (perhaps as a stern lesson about the seriousness of sin, or the need
for purity in Israel to eventually bring forth the Messiah, etc.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in older Believer tradition (like some Church Fathers and later theological
readings), troubling texts were often <span class=s1><b>interpreted
allegorically</b></span> rather than literally. For instance, the genocidal
wars were re-read as metaphors for <span class=s1><b>spiritual warfare</b></span>
– the eradication of sin from one’s life. The famous early Believer scholar
Origen taught that when Joshua battles the Canaanites, it can symbolize the
soul’s battle against vices; thus God’s command to “destroy them utterly” is
applied to how ruthlessly we should root out sin, not to actual human violence.
This approach allowed Believers to derive edifying meaning without endorsing
the surface brutality. Likewise, the erotic and polygamous aspects of the
patriarchs’ lives could be allegorized (e.g., the two wives of Jacob, Leah and
Rachel, were seen as symbols of different covenants, rather than models for
marital practice). The <span class=s1><b>Catholic tradition</b></span> has long
allowed for non-literal “spiritual senses” of Scripture, meaning that even if
the literal sense is harsh, the underlying spiritual lesson might be different
and more uplifting. This is a way of <span class=s1><b>sidestepping the ethical
issue</b></span> by saying the text’s ultimate purpose isn’t to teach ethics in
that instance but to prefigure some spiritual truth. For example, one Catholic
Answers resource notes that interpreting difficult Old Testament violence
requires expertise and reading “within the Believer perspective, which has as
its ultimate key the gospel” – in practice, this means seeing those events as
part of salvation history or allegory, not as moral directives to imitate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

defense is to stress that the Bible also contains the seeds of the very <span
class=s1><b>moral truths that later abolished slavery and improved women’s
status</b></span>. For instance, Believers often point out that Genesis says <span
class=s1><b>humans (male and female) are made in God’s image</b></span>,
implying equal value (Genesis 1:27). They cite Jesus’s unusually respectful
treatment of women and outcasts as evidence that the <i>trajectory</i> of the
Bible is toward dignity and compassion. They also note that the New Testament
taught love of neighbor and even love of enemy as supreme commandments, which,
if fully realized, would negate the mistreatment of others. Saint Paul’s little
letter to Philemon is often leveraged: Paul doesn’t explicitly command Philemon
to free Onesimus, but he strongly hints that Philemon should treat this slave
as a beloved brother in Christ. <i>“Receive him as you would receive me,”</i>
Paul writes (Philem. 1:17) and speaks of Onesimus now being “more than a slave,
a brother.” Apologists interpret this as Paul <i>sowing the seeds of abolition</i>,
effectively telling a Believer slaveowner that the Believer thing to do is
manumit (free) the slave. Similarly, Galatians 3:28’s statement <i>“there is
neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in
Christ Jesus”</i> is frequently cited as the grand principle that outweighs the
culturally specific regulations. Traditional defenders argue that <span
class=s1><b>Christianity ultimately undermined slavery and elevated the status
of women</b></span> over time because of these core teachings, even if the
earliest Believers did not directly overturn social institutions. They credit
the Bible with a <i>revolutionary concept of human equality before God</i> that
eventually, under the influence of the gospel, made practices like slavery
untenable. This view portrays problematic verses as <span class=s1><b>misunderstood
or secondary</b></span> in light of the overarching biblical message of love,
justice, and the equal worth of every person. For example, one Believer blogger
claims that <i>“the deeper you go into the Bible’s view of women, the more
clear it becomes that… the Bible undermines the oppression of women at every
turn.”</i> While a surface reading finds regressive rules, these apologists
contend that in context the Bible was actually progressive for its time and set
principles that led to greater freedom later. In essence, they say: <i>Don’t
just read the isolated harsh passages; see the big picture of redemption and
improvement.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>All of these
approaches—contextualizing historically, dividing old covenant from new,
reading difficult texts metaphorically, trusting God’s higher reasons, and
emphasizing the Bible’s positive values—are employed by traditional Believer
teachers to <span class=s2><b>explain why the problematic passages do not
actually impugn the Bible’s goodness or God’s character</b></span>. For
example, the Catholic Church teaches that one <span class=s2><b>“cannot simply
mechanically apply”</b></span> every sentence of the Bible today as a moral
absolute ; one must discern the intent in context. Catholic apologists
explicitly acknowledge that the Old Testament authors <span class=s2><b>“were
not privy to the fullness of divine revelation”</b></span> and may have
genuinely thought God wanted certain violent acts, even if God in His
providence was accommodating their mindset . They maintain that <i>for doctrine
and salvation</i>, the Bible is without error, but this allows that some
commandments were temporary or culturally bound. Meanwhile, many evangelical
Protestant apologists hold that <i>the Bible, correctly understood</i>, does
not endorse anything unjust—so if it seems to, we must be misinterpreting or
missing context. For instance, an evangelical writer, after examining the
conquest narratives, might conclude: <i>“God did command the Canaanite war, but
it was a unique, unrepeatable act of judgment in salvation history, morally
justified by the circumstances and by God’s rights as Judge.”</i>
Simultaneously, another evangelical (like Greg Boyd, crossing into a more
liberal stance) might say: <i>“No, God could not have literally commanded
genocide; those texts reflect the human author’s fallen perspective.”</i> Yet
even Boyd doesn’t simply throw the text away; he tries to see the crucified
Christ as the lens, suggesting that the ugliness of such texts reveals the
ugliness of human sin that Christ bore. In sum, traditional approaches either <span
class=s2><b>justify the passages within a larger divine plan</b></span> or <span
class=s2><b>reinterpret them in less offensive ways</b></span>. The goal is to
uphold the Bible as <i>not fundamentally immoral</i>. The most common refrain
is that <i>the Bible must be read in context</i> – historical, cultural, and
canonical (i.e. in the context of the whole Bible). As one Believer source
advises, <i>“When you come to a problematic passage… remain humble, reserve
judgment, and get to know the land”</i> (meaning the culture of the time) .
This humility before the text is urged so that one might find an explanation
that resolves the moral tension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Modern liberal Believers often take
a different tack: they may question the traditional view of the Bible’s
perfection or accept that some biblical commands and narratives are simply <span
class=s2><b>wrong by today’s standards</b></span> (since they were a product of
their time). Liberal theology tends to emphasize <span class=s2><b>the spirit
over the letter</b></span>, and the idea of an ongoing revelation or ethical
discernment guided by reason, experience, and the core gospel values. Here are
some key points in liberal Believer responses:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=s1><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Acknowledging Human Influence and
Error:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Liberal Believers are
generally more willing to say that the Bible, while inspired, is also <span
class=s1><b>a very human document</b></span>, reflecting the imperfections and
limited understandings of its authors. They might affirm that <i>God’s
character is loving and just, but the biblical writers at times depicted God as
sanctioning things that, in truth, God would not endorse.</i> For example,
theologian Gregory Boyd argues that when Israel attributed violence to God, it
was because of their “<span class=s1><b>fallen, violence-prone minds</b></span>”
assuming God must be like other warrior deities . This doesn’t mean the text
has no value – it might reveal how God accommodates human weakness or it might
carry a deeper message – but it means not every command recorded is a direct
reflection of God’s heart. A liberal Believer might straightforwardly say: <i>the
slavery laws in the Old Testament, though in Scripture, do not represent the
ultimate ethic God desires; they represent what ancient people thought was
acceptable.</i> Similarly, some assert that the command to stone gays (Lev.
20:13) or apostates was never something God wanted; rather it was the ancient
community’s way of enforcing identity, included in their scriptures. This
approach frankly admits there are <span class=s1><b>“errors and harmful
teachings”</b></span> in the Bible due to the <i>“ignorant, superstitious, and
cruel age”</i> in which it was written . This echoes humanist critiques but
coming from believers who nonetheless cherish the Bible’s higher truths.
Essentially, liberal Believers might separate <i>the timeless message (e.g.
love, justice, mercy)</i> from <i>the time-bound baggage</i>. They rely on <span
class=s1><b>moral intuition and core biblical principles</b></span> to judge
those parts of scripture. If a passage contradicts the revelation of love in
Jesus, they feel justified in repudiating that passage’s face value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=s1><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reinterpretation Through Jesus and
Love:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Many liberal Believers
take <i>“reading in the light of Jesus”</i> even further than Catholics, to
effectively filter out or transform problematic texts. For instance, they might
point to Jesus in the Gospels correcting the Old Law: <i>“You have heard it
said, but I say to you…”</i> as precedent that not all Old Testament
regulations are final. Jesus prioritized love, mercy, and justice – <i>“the
weightier matters of the law”</i> (Matthew 23:23) – and said all the law and
prophets hang on the commands to love God and neighbor. Therefore, anything in
Scripture that seems to violate the law of love must be re-read or set aside. A
stark example: some liberal Believers view the <span class=s1><b>genocidal
narratives</b></span> as incompatible with the God revealed in Jesus. They may
conclude those stories are <span class=s1><b>theologically flawed portrayals</b></span>
– perhaps Israel <i>believed</i> God told them to do that, but in reality, they
were wrong. This is admittedly a bold stance, as it challenges traditional
doctrines of biblical inerrancy. Yet, increasing numbers of Believers (especially
in mainline Protestant and progressive evangelical circles) are embracing a
more critical approach. They might say: <i>The Bible contains God’s word, but
also contains human words that we must discern and sometimes disagree with.</i>
This is akin to how one might treat church history – there are holy
inspirations and also regrettable errors. Progressive Believer writers often
encourage <i>“truth-telling”</i> about the Bible, not glossing over the tough
parts. One such writer frankly states that it’s troublesome when
“truth-telling” the Bible’s story involves describing <i>“a God being violent
and commanding humans to be violent”</i>, and criticizes the tendency to either
explain it away or ignore it in the church . Instead, they advocate openly
wrestling with these texts, possibly concluding they reflect ancient people’s
perceptions rather than God’s ideal will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

modern Believers operate with a “<span class=s1><b>canon within the canon</b></span>”
– elevating certain scriptures (like the teachings of Jesus, the prophets’
calls for justice, or the epistles’ statements of equality in Christ) as more
authoritative and central, and downplaying others. This is done implicitly by
sermon choices and explicitly by some theologians. For example, a liberal
preacher might never preach on the herem in Samuel or the rape laws in
Deuteronomy, focusing instead on texts that accord with the gospel message as
they see it. If pressed, they might say those troubling texts are <i>“not the
Word of God for us today.”</i> This resembles what the early church heretic
Marcion did (he rejected the OT and parts of the NT), except modern liberals
don’t usually remove them from the Bible; they just interpret them in such a
way that they carry a different message (or no binding message). The extreme
form is to say outright: <i>the God and Father of Jesus Christ is not
accurately represented by the genocide-commanding Yahweh in those passages</i>.
That veers toward a dualistic view of Scripture. Few mainstream churches go
that far formally, but many individual Believers have internal discomfort that
leads them to quietly set those texts aside as “not like the God I know.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be seen not as exact accounts but as legendary stories common to that era,
which carry theological symbolism (judgment and new beginnings, or God’s
faithfulness) rather than precise moral instruction. If they are not literal,
then the moral issue of God actually doing or ordering those things is somewhat
softened (though the problem of it being in Scripture remains). Similarly, some
read the binding of Isaac as a story that ultimately taught Israel that God
does <i>not</i> desire child sacrifice (since God stopped it), thus flipping
its implication to a positive lesson – albeit taught via a disturbing scenario.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'> Liberal Believers often embrace that <span class=s1><b>Believer
ethics have developed</b></span> under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, beyond
the letter of Scripture. They point out that <i>even within the Bible</i>,
later texts modify earlier ones – for instance, Israel’s prophets critiqued
excessive violence and oppression, moving the dial forward (the prophets
“vigorously challenged every kind of injustice and violence” in their context
). This developmental view says the trajectory continued after the Bible too:
the abolition of slavery, elevation of women’s rights, rejection of religious
coercion, etc., are seen as <i>fruits of the gospel working in history</i>,
even if the Bible itself hadn’t fully fleshed them out. Therefore, a modern Believer
can in good conscience say “slavery is wrong” or “religious tolerance is good” <i>despite</i>
the Bible’s silence or contrary laws, because they see themselves as carrying
forward the trajectory initiated in Scripture. <span class=s1><b>Love</b></span>
becomes the supreme hermeneutic; as 19th-century abolitionist and revivalist
John Wesley said, “whatever in Scripture is contrary to love is, in that
respect, not obligatory.” This captures the liberal ethos: the <span class=s1><b>spirit
of the law (love, justice, compassion)</b></span> always trumps the <span
class=s1><b>letter</b></span> when they conflict.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It’s worth noting that <span
class=s2><b>not only liberals, but many moderate, everyday Believers</b></span>
who might not label themselves “liberal” often instinctively use some of these
approaches. For example, plenty of Believers in pews today simply ignore the
harsh Old Testament laws and focus on Jesus. They may not articulate a formal
doctrine of errancy, but practically they prioritize. This pragmatic
selectivity is a form of the “canon within canon” approach borne of moral
intuition. In academia, liberal biblical scholars like those in the “Texts of
Terror” tradition (Phyllis Trible, etc.) explicitly shine a light on the
Bible’s problematic passages from a feminist or liberationist perspective,
sometimes <span class=s2><b>lamenting</b></span> them rather than defending
them, but still finding value in struggling with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To illustrate a liberal Believer
stance: A progressive Believer author might write, <i>“Yes, the Bible includes
horrendous things: genocide, slavery, misogyny. Those reflect the cultures in
which the Bible was written, not the eternal heart of God. The true Word of God
is seen in Jesus—loving, forgiving, non-violent. So we must ‘filter’ the Bible
through Jesus. If a scripture passage doesn’t look like Jesus, we question it.”</i>
This kind of reasoning is increasingly common in many mainline Protestant

was impossible to carry out , effectively nullifying it). Today’s Believer
interpreters do something analogous: they wrestle and rethink, motivated by the
conviction that <i>God ultimately is good and just</i>, therefore scriptures
that seem to say otherwise must be handled in a way that upholds that
goodness—either by contextual explanation (traditional) or by honestly
admitting those verses do not fully capture God’s will (liberal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Context:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Skeptics argue that
an all-good, all-powerful God could have <span class=s1><b>established higher
moral standards from the start</b></span>. If slavery is wrong, why not <span
class=s1><b>forbid it outright</b></span> in the Ten Commandments? If God could
tell the Israelites not to eat pork or shellfish, He presumably could have told
them not to own people or not to treat women as property. The explanation that
people were “not ready” for such revelation strikes some as unconvincing – it
makes God seem <span class=s1><b>limited by human culture</b></span>. Moreover,
there are examples of ancient moral codes outside Israel that show relative
advances (for instance, some cultures prohibited certain kinds of slavery or
granted women more rights in some areas). If human societies could sometimes
exceed the Bible’s ethics, why couldn’t God have led Israel to be a beacon of a
radically different morality? The progressive revelation idea also risks
implying God <span class=s1><b>temporarily approved of evil</b></span>. Saying
God tolerated a lesser evil (slavery, etc.) for a time might make sense up to a
point (analogous to divorce being allowed for the “hardness of hearts,” as
Jesus said), but outright commands to massacre infants or to stone women caught
in adultery – these are active things, not just permitted but <span class=s1><b>directly
commanded in Scripture</b></span>. Can God be exonerated for that by claiming
“it was a different stage in revelation”? Some ethicists say <i>no</i> –
genocide is genocide, regardless of context; a perfectly good deity would not
order it at one stage and then later say “actually, love your enemies” at
another. The <span class=s1><b>moral contradiction is too stark</b></span> to
be brushed aside as gradual change. As one theologian (David Bentley Hart) has
been paraphrased: <i>if we cannot tell the moral difference between Jesus
laying down His life in love and Moses laying waste to a city of infants, then
what can we know about God at all?</i> . In other words, calling it “progress”
doesn’t resolve the <span class=s1><b>dissonance</b></span>; it actually
highlights it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Distinction:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Critics note that
even the New Testament doesn’t directly reject slavery or patriarchy. Jesus and
the apostles did not lead a social revolution against those institutions. So if
one says “that was the Old Testament; the New Testament fixes it,” one must
face that <span class=s1><b>the New Testament itself contains endorsements of
slavery and of women’s subordination</b></span> (albeit with a more benevolent
tone). For centuries, Believers used the New Testament to justify keeping women
silent and slaves obedient. It is only in the very recent past that mainstream Believer
thought has largely abandoned those readings. This suggests the improvement
came more from <span class=s1><b>humanistic and Enlightenment influence</b></span>
than straight biblical exegesis. The Bible itself, taken as a whole, did not
unequivocally set out the modern ideals. Furthermore, if we excuse the Old
Testament by saying it’s superseded, we risk a form of Marcionism (discarding
the OT God as different). Traditional Believerity actually teaches that the God
of the Old and New Testaments is the same and <i>does not change</i>. So it’s a
theological conundrum: how to reconcile the <span class=s1><b>merciful Father
of Jesus</b></span> with the <span class=s1><b>Yahweh who ordered banishments</b></span>.
Some say the solution is to see continuity (the OT judgment acts are also part
of God’s justice, and the NT still has judgment like Hell). Others, more
liberal, effectively do side with a kind of Marcionite tendency, prioritizing
the NT ethic and sidelining the OT one. But then one must question in what
sense the whole Bible is authoritative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'> While certainly some war texts might be exaggerated,
not all troubling passages can be waved off as hyperbole. The slaughter of the
Canaanites is described in such detail and with theological rationale (to avoid
idolatry) that it seems more than just “trash talk.” Even if phrases like
“utterly destroy” had a rhetorical flair, the intent was clearly to <span
class=s1><b>eliminate those populations from the land</b></span>. The narrative
of Jericho, for instance, is not written like a metaphor – it recounts every
living thing being killed except one family. If hyperbole, it’s oddly specific.
Moreover, <span class=s1><b>archaeology</b></span> may suggest such total
destruction didn’t happen exactly as told (some cities were not destroyed when
Bible says, etc.), which could support the “not literal” view. But that opens
another can of worms about the Bible’s historical accuracy. Another misinterpretation
argument is when apologists say “that verse doesn’t mean what it looks like.”
Take Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (rape victim marrying rapist): some argue the Hebrew
word might imply seduction, not rape. However, most scholars and traditional
translators do read it as rape (in contrast to the scenario in 22:25-27 which
explicitly describes rape of a betrothed woman). The <i>apologetic re-reading
often appears forced</i>, seemingly trying to sanitize the text after the fact.
Critics accuse such approaches of <span class=s1><b>intellectual dishonesty</b></span>
or excessive spin. They contend that the plain reading of many of these texts <i>is</i>
what it appears – ethically problematic – and it’s only our modern sensibilities
that make us scramble to reinterpret them. As for the idea that women’s silence
verses were interpolations – even if true (and many think it plausible for 1
Cor 14:34-35 ), that just shows that early church leaders held those views
strongly enough to insert them. The fact remains that those words are in the
canonical Bible and have been read as such for centuries. Claiming “that part
isn’t original” can be seen as <span class=s1><b>cherry-picking</b></span>
which verses to accept. It undermines a simplistic view of biblical integrity,
which is fine for a liberal approach, but then one must admit the Bible itself
is not entirely internally consistent on these issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ways:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> The defense that “God’s
ways are higher; He had morally sufficient reasons we might not grasp” is
philosophically debated. The counterargument is that this essentially <span
class=s1><b>nullifies moral reasoning</b></span>. If genocide or slavery can be
good in one circumstance (just because God supposedly said so), then morality
becomes arbitrary. One could justify any atrocity by claiming a divine mandate.
This is dangerous, as history shows – people have committed atrocities <i>believing</i>
they were obeying God (from medieval Crusaders to modern extremist cults).
Critics like philosopher Raymond Bradley have posed a dilemma: if you say God
commanding genocide is good, you’ve abandoned the very meaning of goodness (it
becomes just “might makes right”). But if you say genocide is actually not
good, then you must admit those biblical commands were not truly from a good
God. It’s a tough problem. Many feel that <span class=s1><b>basic moral
principles (like ‘do not murder innocents’ or ‘do not treat persons as
property’) are universal</b></span>, and even God would not violate them
because they stem from God’s own just nature. Therefore, they find it more
plausible that the texts reflecting such violations are <span class=s1><b>human
misattributions to God</b></span>, rather than literal expressions of God’s
will. In essence, to preserve God’s goodness, one might have to concede the
fallibility of those scriptures. This is exactly what liberal Believers do.
Conservative apologists who hold both “the text is infallible” and “God is
good” end up making arguments that sound, to outsiders, like special pleading.
For example, William Lane Craig’s suggestion that killed Canaanite children
went to heaven and thus it was an act of mercy is widely criticized as a <i>grotesque
rationalization</i>—it implies the Israelites were doing a favor by killing
toddlers (an idea morally repugnant to our conscience). It also proves too
much: by that logic, killing any young child might be “merciful” to send them
to heaven before they reach an age of accountability, which is clearly an
unacceptable conclusion. Thus, <span class=s1><b>divine-command defenses often
raise more ethical problems than they solve</b></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'> While allegory can provide spiritual readings,
critics note that allegorical interpretation is highly <span class=s1><b>subjective</b></span>.
One can make a violent story mean something peaceful by allegory, but that
doesn’t change the fact that for many centuries people <i>read it literally and
acted accordingly</i>. Allegory was actually used by some Church Fathers
specifically to <i>avoid</i> the plain meaning when it disturbed them. For
instance, Origen was troubled by the ethics of the conquest, so he
allegorized—acknowledging implicitly that the straightforward meaning was
problematic. If the text’s literal sense was edifying, there’d be no need to
allegorize it. So allegory is seen as a <span class=s1><b>band-aid</b></span>
that doesn’t address why God would inspire such violent stories in the first
place. Additionally, not all passages easily lend themselves to a benign
allegory. A psalm blessing baby-killing or a law about marrying a rapist – it’s
hard to extract a positive allegory from those without twisting beyond
recognition. Allegory also doesn’t carry weight in ethical debates – an
enslaved person or an oppressed woman in history would not find much comfort in
someone allegorically explaining the verses that justify their oppression. They
needed actual repudiation of those verses’ authority, which only came through
changing how the Bible was applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Seeds”:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> It’s true that
Christianity (and Judaism) gradually moved away from some biblical practices
(like slavery and polygamy). But <span class=s1><b>historical credit</b></span>
is debatable. For every abolitionist who quoted “all one in Christ,” there was
a slave-owner quoting “slaves, obey your masters.” The Bible was used on both
sides. Critics argue that the <span class=s1><b>abolition of slavery and
advancement of human rights</b></span> happened <span class=s1><b>in spite of
Scripture’s plain sanction of those practices, not because of it</b></span>. It
required either reinterpreting or effectively overruling the letter of
Scripture in favor of broader principles. This was not a smooth, inevitable
progression from the pages of the Bible alone; it involved human moral
development, often influenced by philosophy, empathy, and secular thought. For
instance, the Quakers led abolition due to a deep conviction of equality that,
while they grounded it in the spirit of Christianity, certainly went beyond
anything explicitly spelled out in the Bible. If the Bible really “undermined
oppression of women at every turn” as some claim , one wonders why nearly two
millennia passed before any church ordained women or affirmed equal rights –
perhaps the text wasn’t so clear after all. Similarly, one might point out that
<span class=s1><b>Jesus and the early church did not mount a social campaign to
end Roman slavery</b></span> – something modern Believers would certainly do if
they were in that context with their current values. Thus, the idea that the
Bible set the seed that automatically grew is too generous; human moral
conscience and struggle were needed to push beyond the Bible’s confines.
Moreover, some seeds in the Bible can produce bad fruit too: the <i>same Bible</i>
that inspired Martin Luther King Jr. also was used to oppose interracial
marriage (on grounds of biblical separations of peoples). So, appealing to the
“overall message” can become a matter of selective emphasis. Critics accuse Believers
of <i>cherry-picking</i> the nice parts as “core message” and dismissing the
rest as “cultural,” which is precisely what skeptics do in rejecting the Bible.
The difference is that skeptics then question the Bible’s authority entirely,
whereas Believers want to salvage it by reinterpretation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

those troubling scriptures, when taken at face value, have caused real harm.
The <span class=s1><b>Crusades and religious wars</b></span> were justified in
part by Old Testament warfare imagery. The <span class=s1><b>Inquisition and
execution of heretics</b></span> were justified by Old Testament examples of
purging evil and NT parables about slaying the wicked. The <span class=s1><b>subjugation
of women</b></span> had an enormous foundation in the explicit words of Paul
about women’s roles. <span class=s1><b>Slavery</b></span> in the New World was
vigorously defended with many Bible verses, against abolitionists who had to
appeal to broader themes. Children have been abused under the banner of
“sparing the rod spoils the child.” The fact that mainstream Christianity today
condemns those things is progress, but it required <span class=s1><b>overcoming
or reinterpreting those very scriptures</b></span>. The question a skeptic
might pose is: <i>If the Bible is God’s main revelation, why did it not clearly
teach those more enlightened morals to begin with, sparing us so much pain?</i>
Why did abolition and human rights have to wait until fairly recently and largely
in secular contexts to be articulated clearly? This calls into question the
claim that the Bible is an ideal moral guide. At best, one might say <span
class=s1><b>the Bible is mixed</b></span> – it has lofty moral ideals (love,
justice) <i>and</i> regressive allowances. A humanist observer notes exactly
that: <i>“the book was written solely by humans in an unenlightened era, hence
it contains many errors and harmful teachings”</i> . From that perspective, the
Believer defenses look like rationalizations to avoid this simpler explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'> One might also note that <i>within</i> the Bible,
some of these issues are already being critiqued. For example, the prophets
(like Amos, Isaiah, etc.) denounce oppression of the poor, exploitation, and
excessive violence, moving Israel’s ethics forward . Jesus famously said <i>“Moses
allowed divorce because of your hardness of heart, but from the beginning it
was not so”</i> (Mark 10:5) – implying that even Mosaic law had concessions
that weren’t God’s perfect will. This could be extended: perhaps Moses allowed
slavery or harsh retaliation laws due to hardness of heart too. The New
Testament also softens some edges (e.g. <i>“Let he who is without sin cast the
first stone”</i> in John 8, challenging the stoning law for adultery). These
hints support the idea that not every earlier command was God’s ideal. However,
a critic would say: if even the Bible shows these corrections, then doesn’t
that mean parts of the Bible itself were <i>not</i> fully correct (morally
speaking) to begin with? So why insist they were all directly from God? It
opens the door to seeing scripture as a dialogical human-divine process, not a
monolithic dictation of God’s ethics. Many liberal Believers accept that;
conservative ones resist it. But if one resists it, one is stuck defending the
morality of genocide or patriarchy on God’s behalf, which as we’ve seen is
exceedingly problematic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In light of these counterarguments,
some Believers have adjusted their view of biblical inspiration. They maintain
faith in God and in Jesus’s teachings, but they view the Bible more as <span
class=s2><b>a record of people’s journey with God</b></span>, containing
profound wisdom but also reflecting human limitations. From this vantage, one
can frankly say: <i>Yes, the Bible has morally troubling parts. They teach us
how far we’ve come and how God can work even through flawed people, but we are
not bound to accept those actions as right.</i> For instance, a Believer might
argue that <span class=s2><b>Jesus himself</b></span> provides the
counterargument to the OT violence: when James and John wanted to call down
fire on a Samaritan village (imitating Elijah’s OT example), Jesus rebuked them
(Luke 9:54-56). <i>The lesson?</i> The disciples assumed biblical precedent
made that okay, but Jesus revealed a different way – one of mercy. In essence,
Jesus <span class=s2><b>overturns</b></span> his disciples’ violent biblical
literalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>From a skeptic’s angle, the ultimate
counter is that if a holy book needs such extensive explaining away and
selective reading to align with basic moral ideals, perhaps it’s not wholly
divinely authored or at least not wholly reliable as a moral authority. The
skeptic would say, as Dan Savage did, <i>“We ignore what the Bible says about
slavery because the Bible <span class=s2><b>got slavery wrong</b></span>.”</i>
If it got that wrong, maybe it got other things wrong, which means we must use
our own moral reason and conscience (informed by empathy, evidence, perhaps the
<i>better</i> parts of scripture) to discern right and wrong, rather than
treating every biblical command as equal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Many Believers, uncomfortable with
that conclusion, have tried to keep the Bible as a foundation while not
endorsing its worst parts. This leads to the various harmonizations we
described. But each harmonization invites pushback, as shown above. The debate
between Believer apologists and critics on these matters is ongoing and often
heated. However, in modern times even devout scholars acknowledge these are <span
class=s2><b>serious difficulties</b></span>. As Peter Enns (a Believer biblical
scholar) writes, “If God’s Word contains such laws [as herem warfare], what
does this say about God? This is a <i>theological dilemma</i> that simply can’t
be swept under the rug” – standard answers often <i>“ring hollow”</i> . This
candor represents a shift: rather than confidently claiming easy answers, many
faithful readers admit the tension and wrestle with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ultimately, the conversation about
problematic biblical content forces Believers to reflect on <span class=s2><b>the
nature of Scripture and revelation</b></span>. Some move toward a more nuanced
doctrine of inspiration (not everything in the Bible directly reflects God’s
character; one must interpret through Christ). Others double down on
traditional views but emphasize <span class=s2><b>mystery and trust in God’s
wisdom</b></span> beyond ours. On the receiving end, non-Believers often remain
unconvinced by the justifications, seeing them as case of special pleading to
preserve belief in an ancient text. They point out that if any other ancient
book contained these things, people would have no trouble labeling them
immoral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In conclusion, addressing the
Bible’s problematic content requires careful navigation. Believers who wish to
uphold the goodness of their faith have developed thoughtful approaches to
interpret these passages in context, to find redeeming aspects, or to
subordinate them to the higher revelation of love. <span class=s2><b>Critics,
however, challenge Believers to apply the same moral consistency to the Bible
that they would apply elsewhere</b></span>, and not exempt it from critique.
They remind that real human harm has been justified by these scriptures, so one
can’t just ignore them; one must confront and if necessary repudiate them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Both the <span class=s2><b>formal
scholarly analysis</b></span> and the <span class=s2><b>personal struggle of
faith</b></span> come into play here. From a scholarly perspective, one can
trace how attitudes within the Bible and in subsequent interpretation have
shifted. From a faith perspective, one must determine how to regard a sacred
text that is mixed in its moral content. Increasingly, many Believers find a
middle ground: <span class=s2><b>affirming the Bible’s spiritual importance but
also acknowledging its imperfections</b></span> due to the human element. They
argue this need not destroy faith; rather, it leads to a more mature faith that
isn’t shaken by the fact that Scripture reflects a journey and that we are
meant to continue progressing in understanding God’s will (which they center in
principles of love taught by Jesus). They also emphasize honesty and humility
in reading the Bible, rather than denial or whitewashing. As the Catholic
apologist Joe Heschmeyer notes, we shouldn’t be smug or dismissive when these
hard questions arise, but engage them with “gentleness and reverence” ,
recognizing the concern is valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bible’s problematic passages –
involving slavery, violence, subjugation of women, harsh punishments, and more
– present a complex challenge. On the surface, many of these seem to <span
class=s2><b>violate the very values of human dignity and compassion</b></span>
that countless people (including Believers) hold dear. A broad summary finds
that the Old Testament contains laws and commands which today we deem <span
class=s2><b>human rights violations</b></span> (slavery, genocide, death for
minor offenses), and the New Testament, while advancing the ethic of love,
still reflects ancient social norms (like <span class=s2><b>patriarchy and
acceptance of slavery</b></span>) that conflict with modern universal values.
Some of these passages are merely descriptive of human failings, serving as
cautionary tales; others are prescriptive or divinely sanctioned within the
text, thus more troublesome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Believers over the centuries have
not been blind to these issues. They have <i>interpreted and reinterpreted</i>
the troublesome texts in various ways to reconcile them with belief in a just
and loving God. Traditional interpretations often argue that these commands had
a context – they were steps in a progressive revelation, or special cases of
divine judgment, or meant to be read allegorically – thereby trying to defend
the overall <span class=s2><b>goodness of the Bible’s message</b></span>. More
modern approaches are willing to critique the Bible from within Christianity,
choosing to focus on the <span class=s2><b>core revelation of love and justice</b></span>
and treating those disturbing texts as remnants of a less enlightened time.
They may concede that those parts of scripture do not carry normative weight
for today and were culturally conditioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For each defense, there are robust
counterarguments asserting that such justifications fall short. The stark
reality of what the text says, and the historical harm done under its
authority, cannot be fully erased by contextual explanations. Critics maintain
that we should be willing to say the Bible contains some <span class=s2><b>morally
problematic teachings</b></span> and that ethical truth must be discerned even
apart from or beyond certain scriptures. Indeed, many faithful individuals,
while revering the Bible, ultimately follow the <span class=s2><b>spirit of
compassion and justice</b></span> when it conflicts with the letter of a verse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This tension has led to a refinement
in many Believer circles of how the Bible is understood: not as a flat code of
directives where every line is equal, but as a record that culminates in the
revelation of God in Christ, who is the true Word of God (John 1:1). By <span
class=s2><b>prioritizing the person and teaching of Jesus</b></span>, who did
not endorse violence or slavery and who elevated the marginalized, Believers
find a way to affirm scripture’s overall trajectory while firmly rejecting the
problematic elements as incompatible with the character of God revealed in
Christ. Traditionalists and liberals may differ in method, but often their end
conclusion converges: <i>we do not practice slavery because, notwithstanding
its biblical regulation, the gospel of Christ leads us to a different vision;
we do not stone adulterers because Christ taught mercy; we do not keep women
silent because in Christ there is no male or female – and so on</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Thus, even as the Bible remains <i>foundational</i>,
its interpretation is <span class=s2><b>not static</b></span> – it has always
involved moral reasoning and doctrinal development. The process of confronting
these troublesome passages has itself driven deeper theological reflection and
growth. It forces believers to ask, <i>“What is the heart of our faith? What is
God truly like?”</i> If the answer is, as the New Testament insists, <i>“God is
love”</i>, then everything else in scripture must align to that, or be
understood as a partial insight awaiting fulfillment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For non-believers or secular
analysts, the conclusion might simply be that the Bible, like any ancient text,
contains both good and bad, and we should treat it not as an infallible
rulebook but as a historical document – learning from its wisdom while unequivocally
rejecting its immoral parts. From that perspective, <span class=s2><b>the best
“defense” against the harmful effects of certain scriptures is to frankly
acknowledge their wrongness</b></span> and ensure they are not used to justify
injustice today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In any case, the conversation itself
– between the text, faith tradition, reason, and moral experience – is
valuable. It exemplifies how religious communities evolve ethically. As society
continues to uphold universal human rights, Believers largely have joined in
affirming those rights, often finding that the <i>core values</i> of their
faith (love, the equal worth of all before God) support the same conclusions,
even if parts of their scripture do not. <span class=s2><b>Debating the Bible’s
problematic content has, in effect, helped sharpen and clarify what
Christianity stands for in a modern context</b></span>: not the letter of
ancient laws, but the spirit of love embodied in Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This formal analysis has cited
scholarly and theological sources to demonstrate these points. In the next

the same themes in accessible language for a general audience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Introduction: The Bible’s Baggage<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Let’s be honest: <span class=s2><b>the
Bible has some pretty troubling passages.</b></span> People often think of the
Bible as a guide to goodness, yet when you actually read it, you’ll encounter
verses that make you go, <i>“Wait, that’s in the Bible?!”</i> For example,
there are laws in the Old Testament that <span class=s2><b>allow slavery</b></span>
, or that command the death penalty for things like working on the Sabbath or
worshipping the “wrong” god . There are stories of <span class=s2><b>mass
violence</b></span> – God commanding the Israelites to wipe out entire nations,
including women and children. There are verses that <span class=s2><b>treat
women as second-class</b></span>, telling them to submit and keep silent. And
there are even instructions about <span class=s2><b>killing disobedient kids</b></span>
(seriously, look up Deuteronomy 21:18-21 sometime). All of this can clash
pretty hard with what we today consider <span class=s2><b>basic human rights
and values</b></span>: equality, freedom of religion, non-violence, protecting
children, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So, what do we do with all that? How
do people who believe the Bible is holy or inspired reconcile these <i>“problematic”</i>
bits with their faith in a loving, just God? That’s the big question we’re
tackling here. We’ll start by <span class=s2><b>laying out the main types of
problematic content</b></span> in the Bible – things like <span class=s2><b>slavery</b></span>,
<span class=s2><b>violence</b></span>, <span class=s2><b>the treatment of women</b></span>,
<span class=s2><b>harsh punishments on kids and others</b></span>. I’ll give
examples so it’s clear what we’re talking about. Then we’ll consider whether
the Bible itself <span class=s2><b>sees those things as bad or not</b></span> –
sometimes the Bible stories themselves offer a moral lesson, but other times
the troubling practice is just taken for granted or even endorsed. After that,
we’ll look at <span class=s2><b>how Believers defend or explain these passages</b></span>.
There’s a range of approaches: from very traditional arguments (like “it was a
different time” or “God had a plan”) to more modern re-thinkings (like “those
verses don’t reflect God’s real heart, which is seen in Jesus”). Finally, we’ll
go through some <span class=s2><b>counterarguments</b></span> – basically, points
that skeptics or critics raise to challenge those Believer explanations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The goal is to be fair and clear.
This isn’t about bashing the Bible or, on the flip side, ignoring its flaws.
It’s about understanding the issues and seeing how people have tried to deal
with them. By the end, we should have a good sense of where the tension lies
and what kind of answers (if any) can resolve it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Alright, let’s dive into the <span
class=s2><b>sticky content</b></span> first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h2><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>What Are the Problem Areas?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>1. Slavery in the Bible:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One of the most glaring issues is
that the Bible – both Old and New Testaments – <span class=s2><b>seems to
accept slavery as a normal thing</b></span>. In the Old Testament Law, there
are rules outlining how to buy and treat slaves rather than forbidding slavery.
For example, Leviticus 25 tells the Israelites they can purchase slaves from
neighboring nations and keep them as property permanently (those slaves and
their children become the owner’s property) . Hebrew slaves (fellow Israelites)
were to be released after 6 years, but non-Hebrew slaves could be kept for
life. The law in Exodus even says if a master beats a slave and the slave dies
immediately, the master is punished; but if the slave lingers a day or two
before dying, <i>no punishment</i>, because “the slave is his money/property” .
That’s pretty horrifying to modern eyes – it essentially condones beating a
slave as long as you don’t kill them outright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the <span class=s2><b>New
Testament</b></span>, while there’s a more brotherly attitude, it still doesn’t
condemn slavery. Paul, in multiple letters, tells slaves to <i>“obey your
earthly masters in everything”</i> and to serve them sincerely . Now, Paul also
tells masters to be kind to slaves and mentions that in Christ, slave and free
are equal spiritually – but he never says “free your slaves” explicitly. In
fact, the letter to Philemon in the New Testament is literally Paul sending an
escaped slave (Onesimus) back to his master Philemon. Paul politely asks
Philemon to treat Onesimus well and hints that maybe Philemon might <i>voluntarily</i>
set him free out of Believer love . But again, no outright command to abolish
the institution of slavery. Historically, this was used to justify slavery –
slave owners would say, “Look, the Bible doesn’t outlaw it; it even tells
slaves to submit.” <span class=s2><b>Abolitionists</b></span> did find
inspiration in broader biblical principles (like “love your neighbor” and
“we’re all one in Christ”), but they had to argue against the letter of many
verses that were pro-slavery. So it’s a big conflict: <i>human rights 101 says
owning people is wrong</i>, but parts of the Bible treat it as just the way it
is .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>2. Holy Wars and Violence:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Old Testament has some extremely
violent content, often presented as commanded by God. The prime example is the <span
class=s2><b>conquest of Canaan</b></span>. Books like Joshua and 1 Samuel
describe God ordering the Israelites to <span class=s2><b>wipe out entire
populations</b></span>. In Deuteronomy 20:16-17, God tells them regarding
certain cities: <i>“Leave alive nothing that breathes. Completely destroy them”</i>.
And Joshua carries this out in several cases – at Jericho, the Israelites kill
“men and women, young and old” . In 1 Samuel 15:3, God instructs King Saul to
attack the Amalekites and <i>“not spare them; put to death men, women,
children, and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.”</i> It’s basically
commanding <span class=s2><b>genocide</b></span>. There’s also the story of the
<span class=s2><b>Flood</b></span> (God drowning almost all of humanity) and
other acts of divine wrath (like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah – wiping
out cities). Even in the New Testament, the <span class=s2><b>Book of
Revelation</b></span> talks about massive violent judgment at the end of times
(though that’s more symbolic and future). And Jesus, while mostly preaching
love, has a parable where a king says, <i>“Bring my enemies here and slaughter
them in front of me”</i> (Luke 19:27) – which is often noted by critics, though
it’s part of a story, not a direct command to his disciples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The problem is clear: these
scriptures <span class=s2><b>don’t just depict violence; they endorse it</b></span>
as God’s will in those situations. Today, we consider things like genocide or
executing people for religious differences as heinous crimes. We have concepts
of <span class=s2><b>just war</b></span> that explicitly forbid targeting
civilians, etc. Yet here in the Bible, we see infants being killed and it’s
supposedly God-sanctioned. It really clashes with modern moral values and even
with later biblical values of mercy. It also raises the theological question: <i>would
a good and loving God really command that?</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>3. Women’s Rights and Role:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bible was written in patriarchal
societies, so it has a lot that, by modern standards, <span class=s2><b>treats
women unfairly or restrictively</b></span>. For instance, in the Old Testament,
women are often viewed as under the authority of their fathers or husbands.
There’s a law in Deuteronomy 22 that if a man rapes a virgin who isn’t engaged,
the rapist must pay the father some money and <span class=s2><b>marry the girl</b></span>
(and can never divorce her) – effectively forcing the victim to live with her
rapist . This was probably meant to ensure the woman wasn’t left destitute
(since sadly no one might marry her after she wasn’t a virgin), but from our
perspective, it’s horrifying. Another law says if a bride is found not to be a
virgin on her wedding night, she shall be stoned to death (Deut. 22:20-21).
Adultery laws typically treated women as the property violated. There’s also an
odd ritual in Numbers 5 about a wife suspected of adultery – it’s very
humiliating and one-sided (nothing similar for husbands).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Polygamy (men having multiple wives)
is common in the Old Testament among key figures (Abraham, Jacob, David,
Solomon, etc.), and while some stories show it causes family strife, it’s not
explicitly condemned in the law. Women in those narratives often have very
little agency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the <span class=s2><b>New
Testament</b></span>, Jesus respected women more than was typical for the time
(talking with them openly, having female followers, etc.), but when we get to
the <span class=s2><b>Epistles</b></span>, we see teachings that have troubled
many: <i>“Wives, submit to your husbands”</i> (Ephesians 5:22) and <i>“I do not
permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent”</i>
(1 Timothy 2:12). Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 says <i>“women should remain
silent in the churches…if they want to inquire about something, they should ask
their husbands at home”</i>. These verses were used for ages to keep women out
of leadership in church and even to justify societal subordination. They
directly conflict with the idea that <span class=s2><b>women should have equal
opportunities and voices</b></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Even outside the specific commands,
some narratives are disturbing from a feminist perspective. In the Book of
Judges, there are a couple of gruesome stories: one where a woman (the
concubine of a Levite) is raped to death by a mob (Judges 19), and another
where a leader (Jephthah) makes a vow and ends up sacrificing his daughter
(Judges 11). The text doesn’t explicitly say “and this was bad” – it kind of
lets the horror speak for itself, but it doesn’t offer justice or condemnation
within the story, which can be uncomfortable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>4. Children and Punishment:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We’ve touched on some, but to gather
here: The Bible sometimes advocates extremely harsh punishment of children. <span
class=s2><b>Exhibit A</b></span>: <i>“If someone has a stubborn and rebellious
son who won’t obey…then all the men of the town are to stone him to death”</i>
(Deut. 21:18-21). There’s a long tradition in Judaism that this law was never
actually carried out (the rabbis basically said “this never happened and never
will” to make it moot) . But the fact that it’s in the scripture is scary – it
implies a death penalty for a teenager who’s a persistent glutton and drunkard
who doesn’t listen to parents. Today, executing minors – or anyone for
non-violent disobedience – is utterly unacceptable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Then there’s the famous line from
Proverbs: <i>“He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him
disciplines him diligently”</i> (Prov. 13:24) . This and similar verses (Prov.
22:15, 23:13-14) strongly endorse <span class=s2><b>corporal punishment</b></span>
of children – basically, <i>spank/whip your kids to keep them in line</i>,
otherwise you’re spoiling them. This has influenced child-rearing in many
religious communities, sometimes to a very harmful extent (some extremist
parenting books have taken it to abusive levels, quoting these verses). Modern
child psychology generally finds that physical punishment can be detrimental,
and certainly we’d consider using a “rod” or belt on a child as potentially
abusive. So there’s a conflict with today’s emphasis on children’s rights and
gentle parenting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>And we’ve already mentioned how in
war narratives, <span class=s2><b>children aren’t spared</b></span> (that’s a
huge emotional hurdle – imagining infants being killed on God’s command). Or in
Exodus, the Egyptian firstborn children die in the final plague –
understandable in the narrative as judgment on Egypt, but it’s basically God
killing kids to make a point to Pharaoh. So yeah, the Bible has some <i>grim</i>
stuff involving children that doesn’t align with “protect the innocent.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p4><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>5. Freedom of Religion (or lack
thereof):</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Another area: the Bible, especially
the Old Testament, is <span class=s2><b>not big on religious freedom</b></span>.
The first commandment is that you shall have no other gods. Ancient Israel’s
law prescribed death for idolatry, false prophecy, or blasphemy. If an
Israelite tried to lead you to another god, the law said <i>don’t spare them or
even conceal it; you must kill them</i> . In Deuteronomy 13, it even says if
your own family member secretly entices you to worship other gods, “your hand
shall be first against them to put them to death… stone them to death” . And if
an entire town goes after other gods, the Israelites are commanded to destroy
the town completely, killing all inhabitants and even livestock, and burn all
the spoil (Deut. 13:12-18). That’s basically <span class=s2><b>religious
genocide</b></span> or at least mass persecution. There’s zero concept of
“everyone can choose their faith.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Today, freedom of conscience and
religion is considered a fundamental human right. We would view executing
someone for changing religion or for preaching a different faith as a gross
violation. But in the biblical context, Israel was a covenant community where
worshipping other gods was seen as treason against the divine king. So it was a
theocracy with capital punishment for worship offenses. The New Testament
doesn’t set up a civil law like that (Believers didn’t have a nation-state
initially), but throughout history, some Believers imported those ideas –
leading to things like the persecution of heretics or witches, forced
conversions, etc., justified by Old Testament precedent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Summing up these categories: <span
class=s2><b>slavery, violence (including war and capital punishment for minor
things), sexism, child endangerment, and religious intolerance</b></span> –
these are all found in the Bible. Not every page, of course – the Bible also
has lots of positive, loving stuff. But these dark parts stand out sharply
against what we now consider ethical. They can feel like “human rights
violations in a holy book.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So one might wonder: <i>Did the
Bible include these to show examples of what <span class=s2><b>not</b></span>
to do, or did it actually condone them?</i> The answer varies passage by
passage. Let’s briefly address that before moving on: sometimes the Bible
itself kinda <span class=s2><b>critiques</b></span> an action (like David’s
adultery/murder is clearly shown as wrong and punished), but often it <span
class=s2><b>doesn’t voice any criticism</b></span> – it just states it or even
commands it (like the slavery laws). That distinction matters in how we
interpret them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When reading these troubling texts,
a key question is: <i>Is the Bible presenting this behavior as

examples):</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Some stories
clearly show an act as evil or foolish, even if it’s not explicitly spelled
out. For example, the story of the Levite’s concubine in Judges 19 – the
horrific gang rape and murder – is part of a larger narrative showing how
lawless and terrible things got in Israel when “there was no king…everyone did
what was right in their own eyes” . It’s a tale of warning, not endorsement.
Similarly, King David’s actions in taking Bathsheba and arranging her husband’s
death (2 Samuel 11) are directly condemned by the prophet Nathan, and David
faces consequences (2 Samuel 12). So, those are clearly negative examples: the
Bible is saying “David sinned” there. Another example: <span class=s1><b>Solomon’s
polygamy and idol-worship</b></span> in his later days is portrayed as his
downfall – having many wives who led him to other gods is criticized (1 Kings
11). So even though polygamy was allowed, that narrative suggests it wasn’t
great for Solomon’s faithfulness. And the general drift of the Bible’s story of
Israel is that violence and disobedience often lead to disaster – e.g., there’s
a cycle in Judges: Israel falls into moral chaos (often involving ugly
treatment of women and internal violence), and that’s seen as a <i>problem</i>
that needs fixing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the Bible <span class=s1><b>without critique – either neutrally or
positively</b></span>. The prime examples: the laws I mentioned (like those
permitting slavery or demanding execution for idolaters). The texts present
those as <span class=s1><b>God-given law</b></span>. There’s no sense in
Deuteronomy that “one day this will be seen as harsh”; it’s written as what God
commands Israel to do to stay holy. Likewise, when God tells Saul to wipe out
the Amalekites, the narrative’s only critique is that Saul <i>didn’t completely</i>
do it – he spared the king and some animals, and the prophet Samuel rebukes him
for not fully carrying out the ban (1 Samuel 15). So the text’s viewpoint is
that Saul should have been <i>more</i> thorough in killing, not that the
killing was wrong. That means within the story’s moral universe, that violence
was considered right (as a special act of judgment).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Slavery is never explicitly
condemned in the Bible’s storyline. It’s regulated. Paul even returns a runaway
slave, as noted. So the biblical writers did not appear to view the institution
of slavery itself as a moral outrage (some of them gave it a new spin, like
saying “treat slaves kindly because they are your brothers in Christ,” but that
still falls short of condemning the practice).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The subordination of women is kinda
similar: it’s mostly taken for granted. There are positive female figures
(Deborah was a judge and leader, which is interesting; Mary Magdalene was first
to announce Jesus’ resurrection). But the rules given, especially in the
epistles, reinforce a patriarchal order – and they’re presented as the proper
order. There’s no internal biblical critique of “wives submit” – that was
upheld as the ideal at the time, with the rationale often being tied to either
the order of creation or maintaining good public witness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When it comes to children: the
proverb about the rod is literally advice from the Bible (in wisdom
literature), not a cautionary tale. The rebellious son law is part of God’s law
in Deuteronomy; the text doesn’t say “this never happened” – that interpretation
came from later Jewish scholars trying to soften it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of humanity (and thus indirectly teach “this is not what God ultimately
wants”). But many problematic verses – especially laws and commands – are given
straight, with divine authority, and no hint in scripture that they are wrong
or temporary. That’s why these issues are so thorny: we can’t just say, <i>“Oh,
the Bible includes bad stuff as an example of what not to do.”</i> Sometimes
that’s true, but other times the Bible is actually telling people <i>to do</i>
that bad stuff (by our standards).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Now, Believers throughout history
have been confronted with these texts. And believers who hold the Bible in high
regard have come up with various ways to <span class=s2><b>justify, explain, or
reinterpret</b></span> them so that they don’t think God is unjust or that the
Bible is immoral. Let’s explore some of those common defenses or

Passages<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Believers, being aware of these
issues, have not taken them lightly. Over centuries, theologians and preachers
developed arguments to defend the goodness of God and scripture despite these
passages. Here are some of the most common approaches:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>1. “It was a
different time/culture (Progressive Revelation)”</span></b></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> – This is a big one. The idea is that <i>God met
people where they were at in a barbaric ancient world and gradually moved them
forward.</i> So, certain things (like slavery or patriarchy) were deeply
ingrained in the culture; rather than abolish them overnight, God gave laws to
regulate and soften them, with the intention of guiding people to a higher
ethic over time . For example, they’ll say the Old Testament laws on slavery
ensured slaves had some rights (like rest on Sabbath, release of Hebrew slaves
in the 7th year, etc.) – which was an improvement on other nations – and that
planted seeds for eventually seeing slavery as wrong. Or that <span class=s2><b>God
didn’t outright ban polygamy or divorce</b></span> in the Old Testament, but by
the New Testament, the ideal of monogamous marriage was clear (Jesus says
divorce was allowed because of people’s hard hearts, but originally it wasn’t
so ). So, the argument is: <i>God was patient and dealt with people in stages.</i>
In other words, the Bible reflects a moral progression – early on, more
primitive practices are allowed, later on, higher standards are revealed. This
way, a Believer can say, <i>“Yes, the Old Testament had those things, but
that’s not the end of the story – God was leading humanity away from them
gradually.”</i> It’s like how you might handle a toddler vs. a teen – you have
different expectations. Some Believer apologists explicitly compare early
biblical times to spiritual childhood where rules were more basic and strict,
and the fullness of moral truth came with Jesus (spiritual adulthood).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>2. “God had a
specific purpose – it’s not meant to be repeated”</span></b></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> – In terms of the <span class=s2><b>genocidal
commands</b></span> (like wiping out the Canaanites), defenders often argue
that was a unique, one-time command in history for a special purpose
(establishing Israel and judging those particular nations for extreme
wickedness ). They point out biblical reasons: e.g., in Genesis 15:16, God
tells Abraham that the Amorites’ sin is not yet complete – implying God waited
hundreds of years until it was “just” to judge them via Israel. So they frame
it as <i>divine judgment on really evil cultures (who did things like child
sacrifice, etc.), using Israel as the instrument.</i> They also emphasize,
“this was a limited command, <span class=s2><b>not a blanket license</b></span>
for violence.” So we today are not authorized to do the same; it was a specific
historical situation. This explanation tries to preserve God’s justice: the
idea is those people deserved judgment and God gave them lots of time to repent
(they cite that Israel was enslaved in Egypt for 400 years, perhaps giving the
Canaanites time to change; when they didn’t, the hammer came down ). It’s still
uncomfortable, but it’s an attempt to say God wasn’t just randomly endorsing
slaughter – it was punishment on extreme evil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Relatedly, with harsh laws (like
stoning idolaters or rebellious kids), some say <i>these laws underline how
serious sin was in that covenant context</i>. Israel was a special holy nation
set apart; any idol worship or major rebellion threatened the whole community’s
survival and spiritual health. Thus the drastic measures. But – the argument
goes – this was specific to Israel’s theocracy; in the New Covenant (Christianity),
excommunication (kicking someone out of church) replaces execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>3. “Hyperbole or
Not as Bad as It Sounds”</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> –
Another defense is to claim we might be misreading some passages too literally.
For instance, some evangelical scholars like Paul Copan suggest that phrases
like <i>“utterly destroy”</i> could be Ancient Near Eastern <span class=s2><b>hyperbole</b></span>
– like a sports team saying “we annihilated our opponents” . The evidence they
use: some of those texts later mention survivors, or not all towns were
destroyed. They compare it to other conquest accounts from that era that use
exaggeration. So maybe, they say, <i>the Israelites didn’t actually kill every
single person; maybe it was more driving them out or defeating their armies.</i>
If that’s true, then the moral problem lessens (though commanding hyperbolic
“kill ’em all” is still violent rhetoric).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Likewise, some apologists re-examine
the troubling <span class=s2><b>rape-marriage law</b></span>: they’ll argue the
Hebrew word in Deut. 22:28 might imply seduction rather than forcible rape (the
earlier verses clearly talk about rape of an engaged woman as a crime punished
by death; the wordings differ). And they emphasize that it actually doesn’t say
“the woman <i>must</i> marry him” explicitly – it says the man must marry her
(meaning he’s obligated to provide for her) and can never divorce her. Some
Jewish and Believer interpreters spin that as <i>protecting the woman’s future</i>
– basically forcing the man to take responsibility for what he’s done for the
rest of his life, and she’s not left without support . It’s still a deeply
problematic scenario, but they try to say it’s not “rewarding the rapist” so
much as punishing him by binding him to care for her (since he can’t just
use-and-discard; he’s stuck providing for her needs, and the father got a huge
fine out of him too). Many today won’t find that satisfying, but that is an
argument made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For <span class=s2><b>slavery</b></span>,
defenders often say, <i>“Biblical-era slavery was not race-based or necessarily
lifelong chattel slavery like in the Americas. It was more like indentured
servitude or debt slavery. People sold themselves to pay off debts and had
certain protections.”</i> Hebrew slaves had a release year. Masters were told
to treat slaves well. They’ll point out that kidnapping people to sell as
slaves was outlawed (Exodus 21:16 – so the slave trade as practiced later was
technically biblically illegal). And in the New Testament, they’ll say Paul
subtly undermined slavery by calling the slave Onesimus a beloved brother and
by saying masters have a Master in heaven (Col. 4:1) – implying equality in
God’s eyes . Also, that eventually Believer ethics led many to oppose slavery.
So the argument is <i>“The Bible’s slavery isn’t the same as 18th-century
slavery; it was more humane relative to the time.”</i> That might be true in
part (slavery in ancient times could be brutal too, but it varied), yet from
our perspective any ownership of people is bad. Still, this defense tries to
soften it: <i>the Bible ameliorated slavery and planted seeds for its demise</i>
(we’ll revisit how true that is).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>4. “God’s
Mysterious Higher Ways”</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> – Some
Believers, especially more conservative or fundamentalist ones, might
essentially say: <i>“We may not fully understand why God did or allowed this,
but we trust God is perfectly just and good. So if God ordered those killings,
He had a morally sufficient reason – even if it’s hidden from us.”</i> This is
more of a <span class=s2><b>theological surrender</b></span> to mystery. They
might argue that as Creator, God has the right to give life and take it. If we
believe God is the source of morality, then by definition whatever God commands
(in its proper context) is righteous – and the problem lies in our limited
human perspective if it looks wrong. For example, in the story of Abraham and
Isaac, God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son, which seems appalling – but then
God stops him last second. Some interpreters say <i>God never intended the
child to die; it was a test of faith.</i> But others note: Abraham didn’t know
that. The point here is that sometimes things God does might shock us, but in
the grand scheme they have a purpose (in that story, perhaps to make a point
against actual child sacrifice, since God ultimately provides a ram and stops
Abraham).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So this defense leans on <span
class=s2><b>faith in God’s goodness</b></span> even when scripture is
uncomfortable. They might quote verses like <i>“My thoughts are not your
thoughts,”</i> (Isaiah 55:8) to say God’s morality can transcend human
understanding. Or the story in Job, where Job questions God and God basically
responds, <i>“Where were you when I made the world? Can you understand
everything?”</i> – implying humans shouldn’t assume they know better than God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>While this approach preserves a high
reverence for God and scripture, it basically asks one to override their own
moral intuition, which is tough. It’s also potentially dangerous – because what
if someone today feels “led by God” to do violence? We normally would say “No,
that’s wrong,” but the divine command defense could be misapplied. However,
within the biblical context, defenders say those extreme commands had specific
purposes and ceased after that era, so we’re not to imitate them unless God
explicitly commanded (which Believers believe He wouldn’t now under the New
Covenant).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>5. “Allegorical or
Spiritual Reading”</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> –
Historically, when certain passages seemed unworthy of God, some early Believer
thinkers (like Origen, in the 3rd century) interpreted them <span class=s2><b>symbolically</b></span>.
For instance, Origen looked at the genocides and said (paraphrasing), <i>“These
wars represent the spiritual battle to root out sin; we must ‘kill’ the vices
in our soul completely.”</i> By turning physical violence into a metaphor for
personal spiritual growth, they avoided having to think God wanted literal
bloodshed. This allegorical method was very common in pre-modern
interpretation. Similarly, the erotic or patriarchal elements could be
allegorized (like the Church as the bride, etc.). This approach isn’t so
popular today for those specific issues, but some pastors still prefer to draw
a spiritual principle rather than face the literal text. For example, they
might preach on the command to destroy the Canaanites as an analogy: <i>“In our
lives, we can’t make peace with the ‘sin’ (symbolized by Canaanites); we have
to eradicate it fully.”</i> This avoids saying God ever actually ordered
killing people – it treats the text as having a deeper meaning beyond the
literal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Now, the more <span class=s2><b>modern/liberal
Believer approach</b></span> (which some of the above start inching towards)
might be to <i>admit those parts are not reflecting God’s ideal and should be
viewed through the lens of Jesus.</i> A lot of Believers today, especially in
mainline Protestant or progressive evangelical circles, will say something
like: <i>“The Bible is a progressive revelation; by the time of Jesus, we see
the fullest picture of God’s will – which is love, mercy, and inclusion. So we
interpret the tough OT passages in light of Jesus. If there’s a conflict, Jesus
wins.”</i> Essentially, <span class=s2><b>Jesus’ teachings and example (loving
enemies, caring for the least, etc.) override or reframe the old laws</b></span>.
They’ll note Jesus himself said things like, <i>“You’ve heard it said an eye
for an eye (which is OT law), but I say turn the other cheek.”</i> He, in a
way, superseded a previous command with a higher standard of non-violence and
forgiveness. That indicates not everything in the law was God’s final word.
Jesus even prevented a lawful execution (the woman caught in adultery in John 8
– “let he who is without sin cast the first stone”). That story, though of
uncertain textual origin, aligns with Jesus’s character – he often emphasized
mercy over strict judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So progressive Believers might
frankly say, <i>“God didn’t actually enjoy or endorse those harsh things – that
was just the culture and people attributing actions to God. The real heart of
God is seen in Christ.”</i> Some even say parts of the OT reflect Israel’s
misunderstanding of God’s commands. For example, a pastor might claim <i>“When
the Israelites wrote that God told them to kill all the Canaanites, perhaps
that was their perspective – but Jesus shows us God wouldn’t actually want
that.”</i> This is a more radical re-interpretation that not all Believers are
comfortable with, because it implies parts of the Bible are <i>wrong</i> if
taken at face value. But it’s a view out there, intended to reconcile these
moral issues by essentially correcting the record with Jesus’ ethos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On issues of slavery and women, Believers
in modern times typically argue that <span class=s2><b>the trajectory of the
Bible is towards liberation and equality</b></span>, even if not fully realized
in the text. They point to things like: the creation story that both man and
woman are in God’s image (Genesis 1), or Paul saying <i>“there is neither male
nor female, slave nor free, for you are all one in Christ”</i> (Galatians 3:28)
as the ultimate principle. They’ll say the early church planted seeds by
teaching spiritual equality and brotherhood which later made slavery
incompatible with Christianity, leading Believers to abolish it (though,
historically, that took 18 centuries!). For women, they highlight that Jesus
had women disciples, that the first witnesses of the resurrection were women
(in a culture where women’s testimony was discounted), and that there were women
leaders in the early church (like Phoebe the deacon, Priscilla who taught
Apollos, Junia who is mentioned possibly as a female “apostle” in Romans 16) –
suggesting the restrictive passages were more about specific context (like
dealing with disorder in Corinth or women who were not educated yet) rather
than eternal commands to silence women. Many denominations now ordain women and
basically sideline those “keep silent” verses by reinterpreting them as not
applicable universally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In summary, Believer defenses range
from <i>“It made sense back then, but God led us beyond it”</i> to <i>“We’re
misreading it; it wasn’t as evil as it sounds”</i> to <i>“God’s ways are beyond
us – trust Him”</i> to <i>“Read it spiritually, not literally.”</i> Each of
these attempts to relieve the moral tension in a different way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So, do these explanations resolve
the problems? For believers who hold to them, it can help. But there are plenty

it to be <span class=s1><b>ahead of its time morally</b></span>, not just a
tiny bit better. For example, wouldn’t a truly righteous God tell people not to
own other people? Or not to do collective punishment on children? The counter
is, if some other ancient law codes or philosophers (like some Greeks or
others) managed to get certain humanitarian ideas, why couldn’t the Bible’s
authors? It raises the question: <i>Were those harsh laws actually from God, or
just the culture?</i> If just culture, then can we say those parts of the “Word
of God” aren’t really God’s ideal? Many conservative Believers fear that line
of thinking because it could undermine biblical authority. But it’s a logical
question. Also, the “progression” idea implies God changed the rules or God’s
stance, whereas many theologians will say God’s character is consistent. If
slaughtering infants was wrong, it was always wrong – so either God had a
morally sufficient reason (the classic apologetic assertion) or the Bible
reflects human ignorance in attributing that to God. It’s hard to square either
way: if one says God truly commanded it and it was okay then, but not okay now,
it sounds like moral relativism or a changing God. If one says it was never
okay and the Israelites were just wrong about God telling them, then not
everything in scripture is accurate. Both are challenging for a view of
scripture as wholly reliable morally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Apologists say those people were extremely wicked (child sacrifice, etc.) .
Perhaps true, but <i>every</i> infant and child among them was wicked? Couldn’t
an all-powerful God find a way to remove the evil without ordering the killing
of babies and pregnant women? The usual response – that those children might be
“saved” or go to heaven – is not a biblical statement, it’s an extrabiblical
guess to ease conscience . It also basically suggests it’s okay to kill kids
because they’ll be in heaven, which is a scary line of reasoning. Additionally,
punishing kids for their ancestors’ sins violates later biblical principles
(Ezekiel 18 says the son won’t die for the father’s sin). Some say those
commands were a specific exception in a unique context – but still, it troubles
our sense of fairness. It’s essentially collective punishment on a massive
scale. For many, this is one of the hardest things in the Bible to swallow. Believer
philosophers themselves debate it. Some like Dr. Paul Copan defend it with
context and hyperbole arguments, others like Greg Boyd say <i>“God couldn’t
have said that; we must read it as them misunderstanding God.”</i> So even
among Believers, there’s not a unified voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

condemnation:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> It’s true the
Bible often urged kind treatment of slaves, but it never <i>forbids</i> owning
slaves. That’s a stark omission if God wanted to communicate the full moral
truth. It took until relatively recently (18th-19th century) for Believers
widely to say slavery is a sin – and note, they were opposing Believers who
quoted the Bible <i>in favor of slavery</i>. The Southern slaveholders in the
U.S. literally argued they had scripture on their side, which was technically
true – there are many verses telling slaves to submit. Abolitionists had to use
broader principles of love and the spirit of the gospel, but they were going
against the letter of scripture. Critics will say, <i>“If the Bible is God’s
perfect moral guide, why did it not make the abolition case clearly, instead of
giving ammo to slave-owners?”</i> It’s a fair question. The Catholic article
referenced acknowledges it’s only in the last 150-200 years that Believers
turned strongly against slavery – implying prior to that the mainstream reading
of the Bible condoned it. So, one could argue that humans had to morally
progress beyond the explicit biblical text (guided perhaps by its higher
principles, but still beyond the text’s direct instructions). That suggests the
Bible alone wasn’t sufficient to establish what we now see as a fundamental
moral truth (that slavery is wrong). From a secular view, it was Enlightenment
ideas about liberty and human equality that influenced Believers as much as or
more than scripture did on this point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

patriarchy:</span></b></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Similar story –
only in the last century did most churches start embracing women’s full
equality. For the majority of church history, they leaned on verses like “women
be silent” to bar women from teaching or leadership. Even today, some
denominations do (like Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, many conservative
Protestants). They believe they’re staying true to scripture. Others think
those verses were cultural or not intended to be universal. But again, that’s
an interpretation debate. The Bible doesn’t come out and say, “These
restrictions are temporary.” That’s something interpreters read into it to
reconcile with modern values. A critic could say: <i>“The Bible reflects the
patriarchal norms of its authors. If it were truly declaring God’s timeless
will, wouldn’t it have included statements that clearly support gender equality
– or at least not include blanket statements about women not teaching?”</i>
Those statements gave divine backing to sexism for millennia. Even the idea
that “husband is head of the wife” – a lot of Believers still hold to that (in
a “loving leader” way), but it’s controversial today because it inherently
places one gender under the authority of the other. Modern egalitarian Believers
say that was a concession to culture by Paul, not a creation mandate. But to be
honest, the Bible <i>itself</i> doesn’t plainly say “I, Paul, am conceding to
culture here.” That’s an external theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

those Proverbs verses to justify it. The debate gets fierce. Without digressing
too far, the existence of those verses has definitely been used to rationalize
what others see as abuse. It’s fair to ask: <i>Wouldn’t God know the harm
hitting kids can cause? Why then promote “the rod” as a necessity?</i> Possibly
because ancient discipline norms were different – but that means the Bible’s
guidance might be culturally bound and not ideal for all time. Admitting that
is fine for some Believers (who then don’t feel bound to follow those verses
literally), but more literalist believers feel they must obey scripture, rods
and all. That can lead to outcomes that conflict with modern child protection
standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'> This one is easier for Believers to distance
themselves from by saying, “That was Israel’s theocracy; Jesus taught us to
spread faith by persuasion, not by sword.” Indeed, the New Testament church
didn’t go around executing pagans. However, once Christianity got state power
(e.g. post-Constantine), sadly Believers did sometimes adopt similar
intolerance – persecuting paganism, later fighting “holy wars,” inquisitions,
etc., often citing Old Testament precedence. The fact that those violent
passages are there made it easier for Believers in power to say, <i>“Well, God
did sanction violence for righteousness before, maybe it’s okay now.”</i>
(Think of Crusaders thinking of themselves like Israel’s armies, or
Protestant/Catholic governments executing “heretics” like idolaters). In modern
times, most Believers totally reject using force to impose religion, which
aligns with democracy and human rights. But one has to admit the Bible’s own
texts don’t advocate religious freedom – that concept came from Enlightenment
thinkers and was gradually adopted by churches (often reluctantly at first).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Now, a very important point: <span
class=s2><b>Many Believers today do acknowledge these criticisms to some extent
and have adjusted how they view the Bible.</b></span> Not everyone approaches
the Bible as a perfectly dictated rulebook where every command is for all time.
A common approach is: <i>The Bible is a record of God’s relationship with
humanity, progressing to the fuller revelation in Jesus. We have to interpret
earlier parts in light of later parts.</i> That often means saying, <i>“We’re
not under those old laws; they were for that time.”</i> But critics respond: <i>“If
it was wrong then, why would God even command it for that time?”</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Some Believers answer that by
basically saying not everything in the Bible that is described is actually
endorsed by the Bible. For example, they’ll say, <i>“The Bible records people
owning slaves or polygamy, but it also shows the problems those caused, so it’s
implicitly showing it’s not ideal.”</i> This argument holds weight in some
narratives (like polygamy often caused family strife in the stories). But it
doesn’t solve clear commands from God in law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There’s also the <span class=s2><b>line
between descriptive and prescriptive</b></span>: A lot of the violence is in
narratives (descriptive: what happened), whereas laws and commandments are
prescriptive (what should be done). People can excuse some descriptive stuff by
saying “that’s just history, not an instruction.” But when God says “do X,”
that’s prescriptive and harder to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A number of Believer thinkers have
begun to say frankly: <i>We have to admit these parts of Scripture are
ethically problematic.</i> For instance, Peter Enns or Greg Boyd or others have
argued that the Bible is fully inspired but also fully human, meaning it
carries flawed moral understanding in places. They suggest we <span class=s2><b>“pivot
to Jesus”</b></span> – using Jesus’ life and teachings as the lens to decide
what in prior scripture was God’s ultimate will and what was God allowing human
hardness or just humans misconstruing God. In practice, this might mean saying,
<i>“God never actually wanted genocide; the Israelites thought that’s what God
wanted. God’s true character, as revealed in Jesus, is enemy-love, not
extermination.”</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Traditionalists worry that this
approach makes us judges over Scripture, picking and choosing. But here’s the
thing: <i>we already do pick and choose to some extent.</i> Almost no Believer
today is advocating reinstating slavery or stoning adulterers or silencing all
women. So, in effect, Believers <span class=s2><b>have rejected or
reinterpreted these problematic texts</b></span> in line with modern ethics
(which they often claim are derived from deeper Believer principles, though
influenced by secular ideas too). They don’t follow those verses literally, and
they give reasons (like covenant differences or context) for not doing so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Critics might say, <i>“That’s
convenient. You ignore the bad verses and focus on the nice ones.”</i> But many
Believers would reply, <i>“We’re following the trajectory God set – the Bible
itself leads us away from those things towards love. It’s not ignoring; it’s
interpreting with the whole story in mind.”</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>From an outside perspective, one
could argue that a lot of the process is essentially <span class=s2><b>moral
reasoning external to the Bible being applied to the Bible</b></span>. That
doesn’t invalidate it – it might just be how humans and religion work. Religion
evolves as our moral consciousness evolves, often by rereading the old texts in
new lights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One could also highlight that <span
class=s2><b>not all Believers agree on these issues</b></span>. For example,
some still maintain very traditional gender roles citing scripture, while
others champion full equality also citing scripture. On violence, most Believers
now are non-violent in practice, but a few might still use just-war theory or
even think in certain cases violence is warranted (like self-defense or defense
of others – which is a different scenario but related to how strictly they take
Jesus’ commands like “turn the other cheek”). On corporal punishment, some Believers
champion it citing “spare the rod spoil the child,” others decry it. So
interpretation varies widely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To wrap up the counterarguments:
they generally say the apologetics often involve <span class=s2><b>special
pleading</b></span> – meaning if these texts were in any other ancient book,
we’d condemn them outright. We only try to soften them because they’re in the
Bible, which we presume to be holy. For instance, if the Quran or any other
scripture had a verse like “happy is he who dashes your infants against the
rocks” (which is actually Psalm 137:9, spoken by an Israelite about Babylonian
babies out of vengeance), Believers would probably cite it as evidence of that
religion’s violence. But since it’s in our own text, we contextualize it as a
raw human emotion, not a theology. (And indeed, that psalm doesn’t reflect
God’s command, just the speaker’s feelings – but it being in the Bible is still
jarring.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ultimately, whether these defenses
are satisfying or not varies from person to person. <span class=s2><b>Believers</b></span>
who trust the goodness of God and scripture often find ways to reconcile or at
least live with the tension (seeing it as partly mystery, partly context). <span
class=s2><b>Non-believers or ex-believers</b></span> might conclude that these
problematic parts show the Bible is a human product of its time, not a flawless
divine moral guide. <span class=s2><b>Some believers</b></span> even come to
something of that same conclusion (that it’s a human product as well as divine
inspiration) and adjust their doctrine of scripture accordingly, without
abandoning faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>From a practical standpoint in
Christianity today, most will unequivocally say: <i>Slavery is wrong, genocide
is wrong, child abuse is wrong, misogyny is wrong, religious coercion is wrong.</i>
They will back these stances using the <span class=s2><b>overall biblical
message of love, the value of each person, and the example of Christ</b></span>.
But they will also (to differing degrees) acknowledge that there are Bible
verses that, on the surface, say otherwise. So it comes down to hermeneutics –
how to interpret the Bible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Many adopt the principle that <span
class=s2><b>Jesus is the ultimate revelation</b></span> and that he fulfills
and even corrects the past. So if there’s a conflict, they side with Jesus.
Jesus never condoned slavery (he didn’t explicitly condemn it either in the
gospels, but his teachings on how to treat others undermine it), Jesus elevated
women in many ways relative to his culture, Jesus didn’t lead wars, and he
welcomed children and said to become like children (quite opposite of stoning
them!). So, focusing on Jesus gives a very different tone. If one believes
Jesus is God’s true character revealed, one can argue God’s true heart was
always against those harsh things, but God had to work with humanity
incrementally or those parts were human misunderstanding that got included in scripture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is, admittedly, a more
theologically complex solution than simply “every verse is God’s direct command
for all time.” But it’s how a lot of thoughtful Believers reconcile faith with
ethical progress. It’s like the Bible is seen as <span class=s2><b>containing a
trajectory or direction</b></span> – starting from primitive understanding and
moving toward the ethic of love. As one Catholic article put it, <i>“Revelation
is suited to the moral level of distant times… the Bible narrates certain
things without denouncing their immorality in the way we would today”</i> .
That acknowledges, from within faith, that yes, those things were immoral by
today’s standards, and we only know that because God has brought us further
along (through Christ and through the Spirit-led growth of moral insight).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For a skeptic, that might sound like
just retrofitting – giving credit to God for what could simply be human social
evolution. But for a believer, it’s not just secular progress; it’s God’s
guidance over time (often working through human agents, Believer or not, even
through secular movements to challenge the church to be more like Christ).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There isn’t a single neat answer

hard to reconcile. If one sees the Bible as a record of a journey toward a

imperfect ethics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>From a faith standpoint, many will

regulations were for a time and place.</i> That may sound like cherry-picking
to some, but it’s a way to preserve the central thrust (which even critics
often admire – e.g. the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount) while acknowledging
not everything in the text aligns with that central thrust. It’s a tension

presented in scripture, how Believers try to defend it, and what counterpoints
exist</i>. With that information, one can make a more informed judgment or
continue the conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It’s certainly one of the most
challenging aspects of biblical religion: squaring an ancient text with modern
moral understanding. Many would argue this ongoing grappling is a healthy part
of a living faith – we don’t just mindlessly quote verses; we have to deeply
think about ethics, context, and the heart of the message. In doing so,
believers can claim they are actually following the example of Jesus, who told
the Pharisees to not neglect the “weightier matters of the law – justice,
mercy, and faithfulness” (Matthew 23:23). That implies that some matters (like
love and justice) are weightier than rituals or regulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So, if justice and mercy say “don’t
enslave or harm others,” Believers today choose those principles as weightier
than the ancient rules regulating slavery or commanding violence. They would
say that this <i>is</i> in line with what the Bible as a whole – especially the
teachings of Jesus – leads us to. Critics may remain skeptical and view it as
the religion catching up to secular morals. Either way, the result is that
mainstream Christianity no longer upholds those problematic instructions – and
in fact, often leads campaigns for human rights, precisely appealing to Believer
values (ironic given the past, but true in many cases today).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span class=s2><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To sum up</span></b></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>: The Bible’s problematic content (slavery, violence,
sexism, etc.) is real and must be acknowledged. Within the Bible’s narrative,
some of it was simply part of the culture and even commanded for that context. Believers
have developed interpretive frameworks to handle these issues, focusing on the
overarching message of love and the example of Christ to guide which scriptures
reflect God’s ideal and which were temporary or human elements.
Counterarguments challenge those frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies and
moral issues. It’s an ongoing dialogue – one that has actually driven much
positive change in how the Bible is applied. In a way, wrestling with these
texts has helped religious communities clarify what their faith is truly about
(e.g., deciding that yes, the heart of God’s will is love and justice, so
anything that contradicts that, even if in scripture, has to be read in context
or left behind).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In modern Christianity, you’ll
rarely find anyone defending those troubling practices as acceptable now – that
itself speaks to how the faith has evolved in understanding. Many believers
would say that’s because of the influence of Jesus and the Holy Spirit guiding
human conscience. Skeptics might say it’s humanistic progress pressuring
religion to reform. Possibly it’s both. But at the end of the day, the majority
of Believers today strongly affirm universal human rights and would distance
themselves from the problematic content of their own scriptures, often with a
nuanced theological explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=p2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=p1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For a reader coming across these
issues, it can be jarring, but it also opens up important conversations about
interpretation, the nature of scripture, and moral theology. It forces one to
think deeply – which, arguably, is better than unthinking acceptance. As one
learns, the Bible is not a monolithic code of conduct; it’s a complex
collection of stories, laws, poetry, letters – spanning a long period. It
reflects growth and conflict. Understanding that context can help make sense of
why not everything in it aligns with what we now consider good. And for Believers,
it underscores the need to read <span class=s2><b>wisely and compassionately</b></span>,
always considering how to live out the core ethic of love that they believe the
Bible (and supremely Jesus) teaches, even if that means setting aside certain
prescriptions that belonged to another era.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
